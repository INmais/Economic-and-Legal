Most Utilities operated under a Monopoly, namely a horizontal one, where Generation, Transmission, Distribution and Delivery, was done by the same entity. To get to a fully liberalised market, Europe has chosen an ownership unbundling model, where infrastructure access plays a central role. Regulation of the infrastructure access´ prices, or guarantee fair access to infrastructure so as the need to guarantee safety so as sustainability of supply, are central issues when arguing about a fully integrated Energy Market. The split of generation, transportation (and grid operations &amp; management) and commercialisation, is reshaping the energy sector. The consolidation and integration of the EU Energy Market present a great opportunity for several stakeholders and a challenge to consolidated utility companies. When dealing with industries that have a common infrastructure, like utilities (which includes energy and water), telecoms, access to infrastructure plays a central role. You can just think of activities where building infrastructure by each player would be undoable, so they all share the same. Most, namely in Europe, was built by Governments, where access to energy, water, telecommunications was a competence of Governments. So when liberalising markets, Antitrust and competition are central concerns on creating and promoting a fair and competitive market. The ownership unbundling model (regulation of the infrastructure access´ prices) is one model used where: Infrastructure´s assets belong to the state (even if concession may be considered for long periods of time, under public interest). There is the coexistence of Free market and last resort suppliers, so the need to regulate relationships between liberalised market and last resort supplier so as these two with the end consumers. The Pricing (of using the grid), such as historical cost, incremental costs, Retail Minus, Free access, Price Caps – will promote different incentives, will define the behaviour of the company managing the grip. For example, if you put a price cap and don´t pay any contribution for maintenance and improvement of the overall grid, most likely you will have and overexploitation of the grid. On the other hand, if you have any top limit for investment, these companies have an incentive to over-investment and, most likely this investment will have some reflection on the final energy prices. Market Shift Currently, we are going through a transition on how energy markets operate, from a centralised monopoly model to a distributed and liberalised market. This transition has been occurring in many countries over the last decade, with particular emphasis on the European Union. With the growth of distributed generation, namely RES (as Wind farms, Rooftop PV), but also with the current technologies Combined Heat and Power Plant, plus as Storage, Electrical Cars (EV), the grid management tends to go from a top-down approach to complex network management. This market transition has occurred in parallel with an energy systems transition, from centralised generation models to distributed generation models. In centralised generation systems, energy is generated in large power plants which are typically located away from final users. Now, with the increasing use of different technologies, namely renewables like wind and solar, it is possible to generate electricity closer to final users in smaller powerplants. Ultimately, users can themselves generate electricity for self-consumption or to inject in the grid. Both these transitions, which cannot be decoupled as one contributed to the other, introduced many challenges and are reshaping the energy sector, technologically and economically. Grid management had to change from a model where only one company was responsible for all activities and where all the flows had one direction (from generation to commercialisation) to a model where many companies can operate both at the generation and commercialisation, but also to a model where the customers themselves can generate energy. So, grid management is becoming more complex due to the existence of multiple players and because energy flows can have two directions. Further, the increasing use of renewables, characterised by their intermittency, as well as new technologies like electric vehicles or storage systems, introduces additional technical challenges. 2.2 Market Players and Supply Chain 2.2.0.1 Market Players As you recall, we are dealing with a model where all players share the same infrastructure (the energy grid – electricity, gas or other). In order to this model work, besides supply and demand players, there´s the need of regulators, Distribution and Transmission System Operators, and entities that their role is to make sure supply always meets demand. The main players in energy markets are: The Governments, which are responsible for planning, and have the ultimate responsibility to oversee that all players develop their activity within the rules; National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs): which are responsible for monitoring and supervising the activities of all agents; The Transmission System Operator (TSOs) and Distribution System Operator (DSOs), which are the companies responsible for managing the physical infrastructures (overhead electricity lines, pipelines, substations, etc.) – the transmission refers to the infrastructure in which the bulk energy between the power plants and cities or between countries is transported; while the distribution refers to the infrastructure in which energy is transported between the transmission infrastructure and the final users. The suppliers (under-regulated, liberalised market or, both), which are responsible for supplying the energy to the energy system (power plants, refineries, etc.) Retailers, which are responsible for selling the energy to the final clients; 2.2.0.2 Supply Chain 2.2.0.3 Electricity Simplified diagram of AC electricity distribution from generation stations to consumers Simplified diagram of AC electricity distribution from generation stations to consumers In the case of electricity, the power plants are operated by the suppliers. Then, the electricity is transported first through transmission lines at a very high voltage (to decrease losses) and then through distribution lines (at high, medium or low voltage) to the final users (homes, offices and factories). Between power plants, transmission, distribution and final users, we have substations that are responsible for converting the voltage and connecting the different layers, acting therefore as infrastructures that provide safety and security to the operation of the grid. 2.2.0.4 Natural Gas Natural gas production and delivery In the case of natural gas production and delivery, the players are very similar. The natural gas extracted at the well is transported (or stored) through ships and pipelines. Several compression stations are placed along the pipelines (or liquefaction and gasification stations in the case of transport by ship) to guarantee the transport. Finally, the gas arrives at the final users, which can be power plants for electricity or heat production. One of the main differences between the electricity and natural gas grids is that in gas it is easy to have storage elements and therefore the match between the supply and demand is much easier to manage. 2.2.0.5 Oil &amp; Gas Oil &amp; Gas production and delivery The oil supply chain is slightly different. The core infrastructure is the Refinery, so the transport of the raw material (crude oil) is commonly a responsibility of suppliers (extraction), and the transport and distribution of the refined materials (diesel, gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas) is a responsibility of retailers. Looking into combined Gas Natural and Oil, from extraction to delivery, we still can split between production, transmission and distribution. Still, in oil &amp; gas you also refer to upstream, midstream and downstream, where: Upstream (Exploration &amp; Production, which includes separation), Midstream (Transportation &amp; Storage), to Downstream (Refining, Petrochemical, &amp; Marketing) As you may notice pipelines play a central role in transmission and distribution, still unlike in electricity, you have more storage capacity. Also, most electricity is also generated using gas (and coal). So, if you think what the costs associated with the different energy fuels, apart from the energy raw material (oil, gas, coal) are, it is necessary to transform and to transport the energy. In the cases of electricity and natural gas, it is necessary to consider that the management of the transportation and distribution infrastructure represents an additional cost, as well as the cost associated with the regulatory activities. Therefore, the cost is not only the cost of how many kWh or \\(m^3\\) you consume. It is that plus all the costs related to getting that unit of energy where it is needed, which basically covers the costs of maintaining the reliability of the energy grid. 2.3 Price for energy Components Looking at the final energy price, we can start by decomposing it into three components: energy, network and taxes and levies. Price for energy Components Price for energy Components The energy component corresponds to the costs of extracting the energy, converting it and commercialising it and are in general charged by kWh of consumed energy; The network costs correspond to the costs of transporting the energy through the infrastructure (transmission and distribution) and include in general a part that depends on the energy consumption (kWh) but can also depend on the power drawn from the grid (kW). It also includes a fixed cost corresponding to the availability of supply. The Taxes and Levies costs correspond to the taxes associated with the consumption of any good (like VAT) but also to levies, which correspond to special payments to the government related to a very specific end. Examples of levies are levies associated with the system operation, such as those associated with particular energy resources (renewables, nuclear, CHP). In this chart1 we see the average weight of each component in Europe and how it has been changing over time. Considering 2008 as a baseline, and 2015, you can see a significant increase of the RES &amp; CHP levies of electricity prices that mostly supported the feed-in-tariff support mechanism of renewable technologies. In a feed-in-tariff scheme, the renewable energy generation agents did not have to participate in the liberalised market because they got a fixed tariff for renewable generation, usually above market prices. This reduced the financial risk of the investors in this project, but it has been supported by the final users in the form of levies. Another example is Levies in Energy Efficiency, which were also residual in 2008, but have been gaining importance in the overall taxes and levies of electricity prices. 2.3.0.1 Household consumers This figure showed the electricity cost for household consumers in European Countries in 2015. Here you can see that not only the base energy price is different but that the taxes and levies relative weight varies significantly, as well as the VAT. 2.3.0.2 Industrial consumers Note “The elements related to taxation policy can be grouped along several criteria into two or more sub-categories. From the perspective of the taxpayer, the tax-related elements can be broken down into recoverable, partially recoverable and non-recoverable parts. Recoverable taxes or levies include full or partial recovery of taxes paid on purchases, either as a payment or as an offset against taxes owed to the tax authorities. VAT is an example of a recoverable tax, but there may be more such taxes and levies which may be imposed on different administrative levels (local authorities, regions, states, federal authorities etc.). (…) In the case of non-recoverable taxes or levies, the full amount of collected proceeds is transferred to the tax authorities. This distinction is important when it comes to retail prices for different types of final consumers of electricity and natural gas. For example, the tax-related elements for households would most often be non-recoverable whereas at least some part of the taxes and levies companies that are paid by companies would be recoverable and companies may further benefit for some special exemption regime.”2 These taxes and levies are a reflection of a country’s resources, policies and targets. In general, in countries that want to push RES, they may impose either taxes on fossil fuels or subsidise RES, or a combination of both. A country may also charge fossil fuels to penalise their negative externalities (like \\(CO_2\\) emissions). So, when analysing the components among the different countries, you will see the impact of such policies and choices on the energy prices. 2.4 Drivers of Energy Prices The main drivers of Energy Prices, focusing on three factors: the primary energy resource costs, the energy mix and the context (weather, geopolitical conditions, economy). As seen in the on energy price components, the main component in cost is, in general, energy extraction, conversion and commercialisation. The cost of the primary energy resources influences the cost of energy directly. In general, the specific cost of fuel per unit of energy is lower for coal than for natural gas. This is explained by the fact that coal is a resource that is more available in nature, requires simpler technology to extract and to transport. At this level, renewable resources are in general the energy resources with the lowest price (except for biomass, whose collection may present a significant cost). The cost of primary energy resources is also affected by the existence of this particular resource in the country or not, in which case that country will have to import the fuel. Regarding the conversion, the cost depends on the investment required to install a power plant or a refinery, the operation and maintenance costs. Nonetheless, the final price is still largely dependent on the cost of the fuel. In the case of electricity, natural gas power plants are more efficient than coal power plants, require lower investments, but still, the cost of electricity produced by natural gas power plants is at the end still more expensive than coal. Finally, the commercialisation costs may be affected by different taxes and levies also depending on the origin. A second factor that influences the final prices of energy is the energy mix. The energy mix is the group of different primary energy sources from which a final energy vector is produced. In the case of electricity, the energy mix represents then the relative contribution of each primary energy resource (coal, gas, renewables, nuclear and others). If the contribution to the energy mix is mostly made by primary resources whose cost is expensive, it will impact negatively on the energy price. For example, countries, where the electricity generation is based on coal, generally have lower energy prices than countries that use more natural gas. Countries that have a significant share of renewables have in principle a higher cost, not directly because of the primary resource cost or the operation and maintenance costs, but mostly due to the taxes and levies collected to support the operation of the system. 2.4.0.1 The EU Energy Bill This chart3 gives you an idea of the relative importance of each fuel used in different activities. In 2014, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 countries amounted to 1 507 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), 1.6 % above the 2020 target. Between 2005 and 2014, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 countries decreased by 12 % due to energy efficiency improvements, the increase of the share of energy from hydro, wind and solar photovoltaics, the economic recession and climate warming. Fossil fuels (including non-renewable waste) continued to dominate primary energy consumption in the EU-28, but as a proportion of total primary energy consumption, they fell from 77.8 % in 2005 to 71.6 % in 2014. The proportion of renewable energy sources almost doubled over the same period, from 7.1 % in 2005 to 13.4 % in 2014, increasing at an average annual rate of 5.8 % per year between 2005 and 2014. The proportion of nuclear energy in primary energy consumption was 15.0 % in 2014. Looking at the annual growth rates for different fuels,4 there is a decrease of gas and an increase of RES. Considering the average annual growth rates for different fuels, there is a decrease of gas and an increase of RES. Still, even have the most average annual growth, percentage-wise, looking to its absolute numbers it is not still a main component of the energy mix. So when looking to percentages, you should take into consideration its relative percentage too. As you may be aware, there are three main sectors: as transportation, industry, households. 2.4.0.2 Final energy consumption by sector5 Considering the Final energy consumption of petroleum products by sector6 , most part is used in transportation. In the final energy consumption of natural gas by sector, households and industry are the two main sectors and Electricity is mostly used by households, industry and services. Buildings most are allocated to households and services sectors. 2.4.0.3 Net Imports 2.4.0.3.1 Considering the EU Reference Scenario 2016 based on PRIMES, GAINS, per fuel and countries (2015)7 High import dependency means that the EU faces an important energy import bill. In 2013, the EU’s estimated import bill reached EUR 400 billion. Since then, falling energy prices allowed the import bill to fall significantly, although the weakening of the euro has partly offset this effect. In 2015, the estimated import bill amounted to EUR 261 billion, 35% less than in 2013. In 2 years, the import bill decreased by EUR 142 billion, about 1% of EU GDP, thereby giving a significant boost to the economy. Crude oil is by far the main component of the import bill, making up 68% of the total in 2015. The share of gas and hard coal was 28% and 4%, respectively. Russia is the main supplier of all three fossil fuels: crude oil, natural gas and hard coal. In 2015, 34% of the import bill went to Russia. Russia was followed by Norway (19%) and Nigeria (7%). The import bill basically depends on the volume and the average price of imports. Like most commodities, energy sources are typically traded in US dollars, and therefore the development of the USD/EUR exchange rate will also influence the import bill (if expressed in euros).” 2.4.1 Context Other factors that may influence the energy prices significantly are the costs associated with the context, which include weather, geopolitical conditions and the economy. Weather is maybe the context factor that mostly affects the prices, in many different ways. In general, cold winters will require the use of much more heating fuels, like coal or gas and as the demand will increase, it will make the prices higher. Reversely, if the winter is mild, the consumption of fuels for heating will drop, and the prices will tend to decrease. However, the weather also affects significantly renewable resources. For example in countries that depend on hydropower plants, dry years will require the use of other technologies, like gas so that the prices will increase, while in wet years, the hydropower plants production will be significant, so the use of other technologies will be smaller and therefore the prices will go down. Geopolitical conditions also affect the prices of resources: for examples wars usually impact negatively on the prices of primary energy resources as in general the extraction is affected. Economic conditions also affect prices. In general, when the economy is growing, the competition for energy resources is higher, so the costs will increase. When we have an economic crisis and the industrial activities decrease, there is less demand, and the prices tend to go down. So, the costs of energy depend on many different factors, and that is why, in general, an energy system – a country or a building – is more robust to energy price variations if the energy mix is more diverse and flexible. 2.4.2 Demand Side Management Until now we only refereed annual demand and supply. Still, there is no perfect match for supply or demand or can easily shift supply forward, to when will be a higher consumption. 2.4.2.0.1 Total Consumption Daily Diagram (08/02/2018, Portugal)8 Taking, for example, the total daily Consumption diagram gives you important information as: Total Consumption; Total supply; Excess or deficient of supply at a given time and; Imports or exports due to the last. You may notice two peaks, one in the morning and another around late evenings. If you think about your daily routines, including factories and services, it´s much a reflection of people´s activities, where during late nights your consumption decreases. 2.4.2.1 Breakdown per source If you breakdown demand you will also notice that supply varies quite differently depending on each source, where solar has a peak around midday, wind late nights, hydro depends on weather and availed capacity, combustion plants most of the times needs a lot of hours to be in full steam and are also used as a backup system, when RES is are not available. RES has the problem of intermittency, so until can secure that supply always meet demand, grid operators have the task: Balancing demand and supply; Securing supply to match demand; Trying to match and manage all available energy sources, according to timely and future needs; Real-time dispatch of generation and managing security The role of the System Operator in a wholesale market is to manage the security of the power system in real time and co-ordinate the supply of and demand for electricity, in a manner that avoids fluctuations in frequency or interruptions of supply. This can be achieved by: Determining the optimal combination of generating stations and reserve providers for each market trading period, instructing generators when and how much electricity to generate, and Managing any contingent events that cause the balance between supply and demand to be disrupted. Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption - EU 289 You have to also take into account the factor behind changes in energy consumption,10 witch changes across countries, such as: Change in Total Consumption. Consumption habit change; Increase in household stock and appliances Energy Savings 2.4.2.2 Factors behind changes in energy consumption in some EU Member States 2005-2013 Factors behind changes in energy consumption in some EU Member States 2005-2013 As you may notice there is an overall increase in household stock and appliances and Energy Savings. A change in consumer habits tends to be hard to implements or promote an incentive to that change. 2.4.2.3 Energy efficiency targets for 202011 As one way to incentive EE, there each country defined its indicative national energy efficiency targets for 2020. Currently, some country already fulfilled those targets, namely Germany and France. Others don´t. Real-time monitoring (smart meters) to: Provide information on Shift consumption patterns to match supply For example, one of the important pieces to promote EE measures is real-time monitoring, or providing users with smart meters. This would enable real-time monitoring of either to provide information to either humans or machines to adapt consumption to market (supply). Demand Side Management, needs that information available in forms that can be used to make decisions on when and how much energy purchase. So when referring demand side management, means doing the best allocation of resources (price) to needs (quantity), considering that prices vary depending on supply and some consumption - the demand - can be deferred to moments where supply is abundant. 2.4.2.4 Adjusted load shapes as a result of DSM12 Adjusted load shapes as a result of DSM 2.4.3 Dynamic Pricing and Intervention in Prices setting Mechanisms Several methods of dynamic pricing exist, depending on two main factors: the granularity of the period during which consumption is metered separately, and the dynamics/statics of Time-of-Use (ToU) prices. The impact on consumers (who can be rewarded for adapting their energy consumption to price signals, but can also be penalised if they continue to consume at peak times) depends on the combination of these two factors, i.e. “dynamic pricing application”, for instance: “static ToU” is a dynamic pricing application in which fixed time bands are set and the price for each time band reflects the average wholesale price in the time band (low granularity-low dynamics). Although less common, a high granularity-low dynamics application is possible, where hourly consumption is priced at monthly average prices; “critical peak pricing” is a dynamic pricing application in which a higher price is charged in limited periods when the consumption peak at the system level occurs (low granularity-high dynamics); and “real-time pricing” is a dynamic pricing application in which the price is posted in real time and communicated to the consumer (high granularity-high dynamics). There are several Dynamic pricing mechanisms, with several levels of granularity. 2.4.3.1 Most commonly applied methods of dynamic pricing for electricity and gas supply and network charges13 2.4.3.2 Share of standard household consumers supplied under dynamic pricing for supply and network charges of electricity in EU MSs – 2015 (%)14 Where the time of use pricing, in blue, is quite prevalent if you consider the Share of standard household consumers supplied under dynamic pricing for supply and network charges of electricity in EU MSs – 2015 (%), percentage-wise. 2.4.3.3 Application of regulated end-user prices in retail electricity and gas markets in EU MSs and Norway (2015)15 If you look to the application of regulated end-user prices in retail electricity and gas markets in the EU and Norway, in 2015, there is still a combination of: Regulated prices for the entire retail market Regulated prices for the household segment Regulated prices for the entire retail market with roadmap to their removal Regulated prices for the household segment with roadmap to their removal And Non regulated prices with (a potential) ex-ante intervention in price setting Non-regulated prices Where, in electricity and gas markets, Non-regulated prices, Regulated prices for the household segment with a roadmap to their removal and Regulated prices for the entire retail market are the most common. 2.4.3.4 End-user regulation method for household segment in retail electricity and gas markets in the EU MS´s and Norway - 201516 If you remember, as referenced previously, infrastructure access’ prices play a central role in energy markets. So when setting the method for End-user, you can see the connection with the infrastructure access’ prices and regulation method for the household segment. Where you see: Regulated prices (discretionary); Regulated prices (price cap, for example by setting maximum % increase, usually indexed to some economic indicator, as Consumer Index Price, Inflation) Regulated prices (rate of return, this one can also be design as the minimum rate return for the utility has to have, scheme quite common in Portugal, not only in utilities but also for other PPP) Regulated prices (other criteria) and Non-regulated prices with (a potential) ex-ante intervention in price setting; Non-regulated prices; Especially in household segment there are special provisions to access basic good and services, as energy is. On Network tariffs, the Energy Efficiency Directive states Network or retail tariffs may support dynamic pricing for demand response measures by final customers, such as: time-of-use tariffs; critical peak pricing; real-time pricing; and peak time rebates. It also states that network tariffs shall be cost-effective of cost savings in networks. Also, network tariffs shall not prevent: the shifting of the load from peak to off-peak times by final customers; energy savings from demand response of distributed consumers by energy aggregators; demand reduction from energy efficiency measures undertaken by energy service providers, including energy service companies; the connection and dispatch of generation sources at lower voltage levels; the connection of generation sources from the closest location to the consumption; and the storage of energy. 2.4.4 Further readings Read “The Tragedy of the Commons” by Hardin (1968) (Link: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/162/3859/1243) Credits: Hardin, Science, 13 Dec 1968, Vol. 162, Issue 3859, pp. 1243-1248 Access “As referred by EU commission”Unbundling is the separation of energy supply and generation from the operation of transmission networks. If a single company operates a transmission network and generates or sells energy at the same time, it may have an incentive to obstruct competitors’ access to infrastructure. This prevents fair competition in the market and can lead to higher prices for consumers.&quot; In order to have an EU Energy Market, several instruments were designed, to create a competitive and fair energy market.

Project evaluation should focus on two dimensions: An Economic analysis, which is a systematic approach to determine the optimum use of resources (capital, human resources) and it involves the comparison of two or more alternatives to achieve a specific objective under certain assumptions and constraints. In particular, it attempts to measure in monetary terms the costs and benefits of the project to the organisation or the community or economy. A Financial analysis, which aims to determine the financial resources to develop the project, like choosing the funding sources (equity or debt). When we refer to the economic analysis of a project, we are most of the time referring to the idea of the Opportunity Cost of a given decision. 3.1.2 Opportunity cost The opportunity cost is the benefit or value that you give up by choosing one option over another. In other words, the opportunity cost of a decision is the difference between the value you receive from pursuing a certain option and the value that you would have received from the alternative that you chose not to pursue. We can express opportunity cost in terms of a return (or profit) on investment by using the following mathematical formula: \\[Opportunity \\ Cost = Return \\ on \\ most \\ Profitable \\ Investment \\ Choice - Return \\ on \\ Investment \\ Chosen \\ to \\ Pursue\\] Unless the investment returns are fixed and guaranteed to be paid (like a Treasury bond you intend to hold to maturity), you’ll have to base your calculation on the expected returns. Example: imagine you want to buy efficient equipment. You have two potential options: Change the lighting system to LED (20% return on investment) or, Installing a PV system (10% return on investment). What is it the opportunity cost? If you decide to leave install a new PV system, the opportunity cost is: 20% (changing the lighting system) - 10% (installing the PV system, option that is being pursuit) = 10% The opportunity cost is the difference between the benefits you would get from the one option (e.g. Change lighting system to LED) over another (installing a PV system). This is your trade-off for choosing one option instead of another. 3.1.3 Time value of money When dealing with financial investments one of the basic underlying issues emerges from answering the question: Do you prefer to have 100€ today or invest 100€ for a future income? The idea of time is quite fundamental in finance, because in general, the money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future, due to its potential earning capacity. Time value of money can reflect that a certain amount of money today has a different buying power (value) than the same currency amount of money in the future, but is not an equivalent. If you consider as geometric series, the first term would be the present value, the common ratio would be \\((1+i)\\) and \\(n\\), number of periods. So we start by this basic formula: \\[Future\\ Value = Present \\ Value \\cdot (1+i)^n\\] Or the present Value of a certain amount of money \\(C\\) (at \\(n\\) year) is given by: \\[Present\\ Value = \\frac{C}{(1+i)^n}\\] If we want to estimate how much is the Present value of a certain future cash flows C that will be collected in the future “n” year, Where: \\(C\\) - Net amount of money (cash-flows) that goes in or out of a project \\(n\\) is the number of compounding periods between the present date and the date where the sum is worth C \\(i\\) is the interest rate for one compounding period (the end of a compounding period is when interest is applied, for example, annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, daily). (The interest rate i is given as a percentage but expressed as a decimal in this formula. If using periods with less than one year, for example, 6 months would be to the power of ½ or 6/12) Compounding is the process where the value of an investment increases because the earnings on investment, both capital gains and interest, earn interest as time passes. This exponential growth occurs because the total growth of investment along with its principal earns money in the next period. This differs from linear growth, where only the principal earns interest each period. If you consider as geometric series, the first term would be the present value; the common ratio would be \\((1+i)\\) and \\(n\\), number of periods. Geometric growth If you notice, more than the interest rate, time plays a central role, or what so-called the power compound interest, so you are dealing with geometric growth, not linear and the reasoning can be linked to the idea of trade-offs. You will defer consumption today, to have a certain return in n years, but because you just will have that return in n years, it is like if you were reinvesting every year. Example: year 0, you have 100€ year 1, you would have 100+1.10 (10% rate), year 2, you start with 110 (and not 100 €), so you will have 121 (110*1.1) and so on. Another way to put is: What is would you choose? 100€ today or; 103€ in 1 year If you consider a 4% interest rate We would level both options with the previous formula. So option 1 would be equivalent to: \\(100 \\times (1.04)^1\\) or 104€ or doing for the present value \\(C_0 =103/104 = 99€\\) So 100€ is equal to 104€ in 1 year and 103€ in 1 year time is equivalent to 99€ today. The time value of money is the assumption that money can generate value if it is invested (for example interests in a bank), so it is better to receive the money now than later. In the end, the same amount of money today has a different and higher buying power (value) than the same amount of money in the future; it is not an equivalent. The rate at which the money is appreciated or depreciate is called the discount rate. This discount rate may represent different factors but is often considered to be the interest rate given by the treasury bonds of central banks at 10 years, usually are used as a benchmark (risk-free) to computed riskier investments. It is often represented by the letter “i” of interest. Example 2 \\(1010=1000\\times(1+0.01), with \\ n=1\\) Imagine that you have 1000€ and you put in the bank with a 1% interest rate. In one year, the 1000 euros you have today will be worth 1010€. In 2 years it will be worth 1020.1€. If we want to estimate how much is the Present Value of a certain future cash flows C that will be collected in the future “n” year, we can invert the future value formula and: example 3: \\(990.01=1000/(1+0.01)\\), with \\(n=1\\) Imagine that you have the opportunity to collect 1000€ in one year. That is equivalent to receiving today only 990.01 € (because if you put in the bank today 990.01 €), you will have 1000 euros next year. 3.1.4 Money Money can also be defined as: It’s a store of value, meaning that money allows you to defer consumption until a later date. It’s a unit of account, meaning that it allows you to assign a value to different goods without having to compare them. So instead of saying that a car is worth ten cows, you can just say it (or the cows) cost 10 000 €. And it’s a medium of exchange —an easy and efficient way for you and me and others to trade goods and services with one another. The idea that a euro today is worth more than a euro tomorrow relates more to the second and last roles, storage and medium of exchange because the value of money at a future point of time would take account of interest earned and the inflation accrued over a given period. Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the purchasing power of the currency is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation and avoid deflation, in order to keep the economy running smoothly, namely by setting interest rates. 3.1.5 Annuities An annuity is a form of investment involving a series of periodic equal contributions made by an individual to an account for a specified term. Interest may be compounded at the end or beginning of each period. The term annuity is also used for a series of regular payments made to an individual for a specified time, such as in the case of a pension. The word annuity comes from the word “annual” meaning yearly. Pension funds involve making contributions to an annuity before retirement and receiving payments from an annuity after retirement. Calculations can be made to find out. What a certain contribution per period amounts to as a fund What size of contribution needs to be made to create of fund of a specific amount When receiving payments from an annuity the present value of the annuity is the lump sum that must be invested now in order to provide those regular payments over the term. Examples of annuities: Monthly rent payments Regular deposits in a savings account Social welfare benefits Annual premiums for a life insurance policy Periodic payments to a retired person from a pension fund Dividend payments on stocks and shares Loan repayments The future value of an annuity is the total value of the investment at the end of the specified term. This includes all payments deposited as well as the interest earned. 3.1.5.1 Annuity-Immediate Consider an annuity with payments of 1 unit each, made at the end of every year for n years. * This kind of annuity is called an annuity-immediate (also called an ordinary annuity or an annuity in arrears). * The present value of an annuity is the sum of the present values of each payment. Example Calculate the present value of an annuity-immediate of amount $100 paid annually for 5 years at the rate of interest of 9%. Solution: Table summarizes the present values of the payments as well as their total. Present value of annuity Year Payment Present value 1 100 \\(100 (1.09)^{-1}\\) = 91.74 2 100 \\(100 (1.09)^{-2}\\) = 84.17 3 100 \\(100 (1.09)^{-3}\\) = 77.22 4 100 \\(100 (1.09)^{-4}\\) = 70.84 5 100 \\(100 (1.09)^{-5}\\) = 64.99 Total 388.97 We are interested in the value of the annuity at time 0, (the present value), and the accumulated value of the annuity at time n (the future value). Suppose the rate of interest per period is i, and we assume the compound-interest method applies. Let \\(a_{n}\\) denote the present value of the annuity. As the present value of the \\(j^{th}\\) payment is \\(v^{j}\\), where v = 1/(1+i) is the discount factor, the present value of the annuity is: \\(a_{n}= v + v^{2} + v^{3}+...+ v^{n}\\) \\(= v \\times\\left [ \\frac{1-v^n}{1-v} \\right ]\\) \\(= \\frac{1-v^n}{i}\\) \\(= \\frac{1-(1+i)^{-n}}{i}\\) Time diagram of n payment annuity immediate The accumulated value of the annuity at time \\(n\\) is denoted by \\(s_{n}\\) This is the future value of ane at time \\(n\\). Thus, we have: \\(s_{n} = s_{n} \\times (i+1)^n\\) \\(s_{n} =\\frac{(1+i)^{n}-1}{i}\\) If the annuity is of level payments of P, the present and future values of the annuity are \\(Pa_n\\) and \\(Ps_n\\), respectively. 3.1.5.2 Amortisation and amortised loans The process of accounting for a sum of money by making it equivalent to a series of payments over time, such as arises when paying off a debt over time is called amortisation. Accordingly, a loan that involves paying back a fixed amount at regular intervals over a fixed period of time is called an amortised loan. Term loans and annuity mortgages (as opposed to endowment mortgages) are examples of amortised loans. 3.1.5.3 Regular payments over time – geometric series Arrangements involving savings and loans often involve making a regular payment at fixed intervals of time. For example, a “regular savings” account might involve saving a certain amount of money every month for a number of years. A term loan or a mortgage might involve borrowing a certain amount of money and repaying it in equal instaLlments over time. Calculations involving such regular payment schedules, when they are considered in terms of the present values of the payments as in loans will involve the summation of a geometric series. 3.1.5.4 Amortisation formula Terms associated with the amortisation formula revisited: Present Value is the value on a given date of a future payment or series of future payments discounted to reflect the time value of money and other factors such as investment risk. An annuity is a series of equal payments or receipts that occur at evenly spaced intervals. Each payment occurs at the end of each period for an ordinary annuity. An amortised loan is a loan for which the loan amount plus interest is paid off in a series of regular payments. An amortised loan is an annuity whose future value is the same as the loan amount’s future value, under compound interest. An amortised loan’s payments are used to pay off a loan. Other types of annuities’ payments can be used to generate savings as for example for retirement funds. We can think of the situation in two ways which give the same end result: The sum of the present values of all the annual repayment amounts = sum borrowed. (This principle is enshrined in European Law) Future value of loan amount = Future value of the annual repayment amounts (i.e. future value of the annuity) Given that A = annual repayment amount, the present value of one annual repayment amount paid in t years time is \\(P= \\frac{A}{(1+i)^t}\\),where \\(i\\) is the annual rate of interest expressed as a decimal or fraction So if I borrow €10,000 over 5 years, when I add up the present values of all the annual repayment amounts, this sum should equal €10,000. \\(10 0000 = \\frac{A}{(1+i)} + \\frac{A}{(1+i)^2} + \\frac{A}{(1+i)^3} + \\frac{A}{(1+i)^4} + \\frac{A}{(1+i)^5} = A =\\frac{1}{(1+i)} + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^2} + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^3} + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^4}+ \\frac{1}{(1+i)^5}\\) 3.1.5.4.1 Two methods of Deriving the “Amortisation – mortgages and loans” formula 3.1.5.4.2 Method 1 Loan amount = sum of the present value of all the repayments (assuming payment at the end of each payment period) Where: \\(P\\) = Loan amount \\(A\\) = periodic repayment amount, \\(t\\) = the number of payment periods, \\(i\\) = the interest rate for the payment period expressed as a decimal or fraction \\[P =\\frac{A}{(1+i)} + \\frac{A}{(1+i)^2} + \\frac{A}{(1+i)^3} + .... \\frac{A}{(1+i)^t}\\] \\[A =\\frac{1}{(1+i)} + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^2} + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^3} + .... \\frac{1}{(1+i)^t}\\] \\(P=S_n\\) of a geometric series , \\(n = t =\\) number of compounding periods, \\(a =\\frac{A}{(1+i)^n}\\) , \\(r =\\frac{1}{(1+i)}\\) \\[P = \\frac{a(1+r)^n}{1-r} = \\frac{ \\left (\\dfrac{A}{(1+i)} \\right ) \\left (1- \\dfrac{1}{(1+i)}\\right)^t} {\\left ( 1-\\dfrac{1}{(1+i)} \\right)}\\] \\[= \\frac{ \\left (\\dfrac{A}{(1+i)} \\right ) \\left (\\dfrac{1(1+i)^t-1}{(1+i)}\\right)} {\\left ( \\dfrac{1+i-1}{(1+i)} \\right)}\\] \\[= \\frac{ \\left (\\dfrac{A}{(1+i)} \\right ) \\left (1(1+i)^t-1\\right)} {\\left ( \\dfrac{i}{(1+i)} \\right) (1+i)^t}\\] \\[P = \\frac{(A)(1+i)^t-1)}{1(1+i)^t}\\] \\[\\Rightarrow A = P\\frac{i(1+i)^t}{(1+i)^t-1}\\] 3.1.5.4.3 Method 2 The future value of the loan amount P = sum of the future values of t equal repayments each of value A made at the end of each compounding period. \\[P=(1+i)^t= A(1+i)^{-t} + A(1+i)^{-2t}+.......A(1+i)^{-t}\\] \\(P(1+i)^t=S_n\\), of a geometric series \\(S_n= \\frac{a(1-r^n)}{(1-r)}\\), where \\(a= A\\),\\(r=1+i,n=t\\) \\[P=(1+i)^t =\\frac{A((1+i)^{t}-1)}{(1+i)-1}\\] \\[P=(1+i)^t=\\frac{A((1+i)^{t}-1)}{i}\\] \\[\\Rightarrow A=P\\frac{(1+i)^{t}i}{(1+i)-1}\\] 3.1.5.5 Amortised loan example When regular payments are being used to pay off a loan, then we are usually interested in calculating their present values rather than their future values, because this is the basis upon which the loan repayments and/or the interest rate are calculated. The interest rate for which the present value of all the repayments is equal to the present value of the loan. In the case of an amortised loan, these present values form a consistent pattern that turns out to be a geometric series. Example A borrows €10,000 at an interest rate of 6%. He wants to repay it in five equal installments over five years, with the first repayment one year after he takes out the loan. How much should each repayment be? Solution Let each repayment equal A. Then the present value of the first repayment is A/1.06, the present value of the second repayment is A/1.062, and so on. The total of the present values of all the repayments is equal to the loan amount. Total of the present values of all the repayments \\(A\\) =\\(A = \\frac{A}{1.06} + \\frac{A}{1.06^2} + ........ \\frac{A}{1.06^5}\\) This is a geometric series, with n = 5,first term \\(a=\\frac{A}{1.06}\\) and common ratio \\(r=\\frac{A}{1.06}\\) The sum of the first 5 terms which is the loan amount is \\(S_5= \\frac{ \\frac{A}{1.06} \\left ( 1- \\frac{A}{1.06^5} \\right ) } { \\left ( 1- \\frac{A}{1.06} \\right )} = 4.212363786 \\ A\\) If \\(S_5\\) has to equal the loan amount of €10,000, then \\(A = \\frac{10 000}{4.212363786} = € \\ 2373.96\\) (could find \\(s_{n}\\) for a small number of terms by adding the terms individually first and then checking their answer by using the formula for \\(S_n\\) of a geometric series). This type of calculation is so common that it is convenient to derive a formula to shortcut the calculation for the regular repayment \\(A\\). By considering the general case of an amortised loan with interest rate \\(i\\), taken out over \\(t\\) years, for a loan amount of \\(P\\), a geometric series can be used to derive the general formula: \\[A= P\\frac{i(1+i)^t}{(1+i)^t-1}\\] This formula gives the same result as (i) above: A = 10000 \\[A= 10 000\\frac{0.06(1.06)^5}{(1.06)^5-1}= € \\ 2373.96\\] (The formula assumes payment at the end of each payment period). 3.1.5.5.1 Amortisation Schedule Assuming a loan is repaid in fixed annual repayments – the annual repayment is made up of two parts – one part interest and the remainder is part of the capital sum borrowed, called “principal portion” in the chart below. The chart below shows that even though the periodic payment is fixed, the part of it which is interest is decreasing as more of the loan is paid off and the part of it which is principal is increasing. Amortisation Schedule An amortisation schedule is a list of several periods of payments, the principal and interest portions of those payments and the outstanding principal (or balance) after each of those payments is made. Below is the amortisation schedule, showing in figures the trends in the interest and principal portions of each payment for successive payments for the loan for example supra €10,000 loan paid back over 5 years at 6% interest rate involving a fixed annual repayment of €2376.96 per year. Payment # Fixed payment Interest portion Principal portion balance 0 € 10,000.00 1 €2,373.96 € 600.00 € 1,773.96 € 8,226.04 2 €2,373.96 € 493.56 € 1,880.40 € 6,345.63 3 €2,373.96 € 380.74 € 1,993.23 € 4,352.41 4 €2,373.96 € 261.14 € 2,112.82 € 2,239.59 5 €2,373.96 € 134.38 € 2,239.59 € 0.00 Steps in an amortisation schedule: Fill in the first balance = loan amount (payment number 0) For payment 1, fill in the payment number and fixed repayment amount For payment 1 row, find the interest on the previous balance using the simple interest formula Calculate the debt payment (principal portion) = the repayment amount - the interest portion Calculate the new balance = previous balance - the principal portion Repeat Steps 3, 4 and 5 for all the other payments from payment 2 onwards For the last payment, the principal portion = the previous balance When all the payments have been made the final balance is €0.00 Explanation of the amortisation schedule Payment # Fixed payment Interest portion Principal portion balance 0 Loan amount 1 Fixed repayment amount calculated using “Amortisation - loans and mortgages formula” Simple interest on the previous balance Repayment amount - interest portion Previous balance - this payment’s principal portion 2 Fixed repayment amount calculated using “Amortisation - loans and mortgages formula” Simple interest on the previous balance Repayment amount - interest portion Previous balance - this payment’s principal portion Last Fixed Repayment = principal portion + interest portion Simple interest on the previous balance Previous balance € 0.0 3.2 Indicators Basic indicators that should be computed to evaluate a project and aid in the decision of developing it or not: net present value, internal rate of return and payback period. 3.2.1 Net Present Value (NPV) The first indicator to evaluate a project, is the Net Present Value (NPV), which basically estimates the value that will be gained at present costs by developing the project. This estimate consists of adding all future net earnings (the cashflows) minus the initial investment that is required to execute the project. \\[NPV_{i, N} \\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n} - Investment\\] Net present value (NPV) of a project is the potential change in an investor’s wealth caused by that project while the time value of money is being accounted for. It equals the present value of net cash inflows generated by a project less the initial investment on the project. It is one of the most reliable measures used in capital budgeting because it accounts for the time value of money by using discounted cash flows in the calculation. Net present value calculations take the following two inputs: Projected net cash flows in successive periods from the project. A target rate of return i.e. the discount rate. Where: Net cash flow equals total cash inflow during a period, less cash outflows from the project during the period. Discount rate is the rate used to discount the net cash inflows. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)is the most commonly used discount rate. Decision Rule NPV result Decision \\(NPV &gt; 0\\) the investment would add value the project may be accepted \\(NPV &lt; 0\\) the investment would subtract value the project should be rejected \\(NPV = 0\\) the investment would neither gain We should be indifferent in the decision whether to accept or reject the project. This project adds no monetary value. Decision should be based on other criteria, e.g., strategic positioning or other factors not explicitly included in the calculation. In case of mutually exclusive projects (i.e. competing projects), accept the project with higher NPV. NPV (even and uneven) The net cash flows may be even (i.e. equal the cash flows in different periods) or uneven (i.e. different cash flows in different periods). When they are even, the present value can be easily calculated by using the formula for the present value of the annuity. However, if they are uneven, we need to calculate the present value of each individual net cash inflow separately. Once we have the total present value of all project cash flows, we subtract the initial investment on the project from the total present value of inflows to arrive at net present value. Thus we have the following two formulas for the calculation of NPV: When cash inflows are even: \\(NPV = C × 1 − (1 + i)^{-n} − Initial \\ Investment\\) In the above formula, \\(C\\) is the net cash inflow expected to be received in each period; \\(i\\) is the required rate of return per period; \\(n\\) are the number of periods during which the project is expected to operate and generate cash inflows. When cash inflows are uneven: \\(NPV = C1 + ...+C_3 − Initial \\ Investment\\) \\(C_1:(1 + i)^1\\) \\(C_2:(1 + i)^2\\) \\(C_3:(1 + i)^3\\) Where, \\(i\\) is the target rate of return per period; \\(C1\\) is the net cash inflow during the first period; \\(C_2\\) is the net cash inflow during the second period; \\(C_3\\) is the net cash inflow during the third period, and so on … Examples Example 1: Even Cash Inflows Calculate the net present value of a project which requires an initial investment of 243,000 € and it is expected to generate a cash inflow of 50,000 € each month for 12 months. Assume that the salvage value of the project is zero. The target rate of return is 12% per annum. Solution Initial Investment = 243,000 € Net Cash Inflow per Period = 50,000 € Number of Periods = 12 Discount Rate per Period = 12% ÷ 12 = 1% Net Present Value \\(50,000 × (1 − (1 + 1\\%)^-12) \\ 1\\% − 243,000\\) \\(50,000 × (1 − 1.01^-12) ÷ 0.01 − 243,000\\) \\(50,000 × (1 − 0.887449) ÷ 0.01 − 243,000\\) \\(50,000 × 0.112551 ÷ 0.01 − 243,000\\) \\(50,000 × 11.2551 − 243,000\\) \\(562,754 − 243,000\\) \\(319,754\\) Example 2: Uneven Cash Inflows: An initial investment of 8,320 € on plant and machinery is expected to generate cash inflows of 3,411 €, 4070 €, 5824 € and 2065 € at the end of the first, second, third and fourth year respectively. At the end of the fourth year, the machinery will be sold for 900 €. Calculate the net present value of the investment if the discount rate is 18%. Solution PV Factors: \\(Year 1 = 1 ÷ (1 + 18 \\%)^1 = 0.8475\\) \\(Year 2 = 1 ÷ (1 + 18 \\%)^2 = 0.7182\\) \\(Year 3 = 1 ÷ (1 + 18 \\%)^3 = 0.6086\\) \\(Year 4 = 1 ÷ (1 + 18 \\%)^4 = 0.5158\\) The rest of the calculation is summarized below: Year Net Cash Inflow Present Value Factor Cash Inflow × Present Value Factor 1 3411 0.8475 2,890.68 2 4070 0.7182 2,923.01 3 5824 0.6086 3,544.67 4 2065 0.5158 1,529.31 Salvage Value 900 NPV = Total PV of Cash Inflows (10888€) - Initial Investment (8320€) NPV = 2568 € 3.2.1.1 Strengths and Weaknesses of NPV Strengths Net present value accounts for the time value of money which makes it a sounder approach than other investment appraisal techniques which do not discount future cash flows such payback period and accounting rate of return. Net present value is even better than some other discounted cash flows techniques such as IRR. In situations where IRR and NPV give conflicting decisions, NPV decision should be preferred. Weaknesses NPV is, after all, an estimation. It is sensitive to changes in estimates for future cash flows, salvage value and the cost of capital. Net present value does not take into account the size of the project. For example, say Project A requires an initial investment of 4 million € to generate NPV of 1 million € while a competing Project B requires 2 million € investment to generate an NPV of 0.8 million €. If we base our decision on NPV alone, we will prefer Project A because it has higher NPV, but Project B has generated more shareholders’ wealth per dollar of initial investment (0.8€ million/2€ million vs 1€ million/4€ million). 3.2.2 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) The Internal Rate of Return (IRR), corresponds to finding out what is the rate of return on the project that makes the NPV equal to 0. \\[IRR= \\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n} = 0\\] 3.2.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) The Internal Rate of Return (IRR), corresponds to finding out what is the rate of return on the project that makes the NPV equal to 0. Imagine you want to develop this project, but one of two things may happen: you need to go to a bank, ask for a loan and will have to pay an interest rate of 5%; you need to take the money from the bank and will lose a 5% interest rate. If the IRR is higher than this (5%), it means you should develop the project, as the value that you will get from the project is higher than what you need to invest. 3.2.4 Payback Period Lastly, sometimes you want to know how much is the period of time required for the return on investment to “repay” the sum of the original investment. So the simple formula to answer that question is given as: \\[Payback \\, Period = \\frac{Amount\\,Invested}{Estimated\\,Net\\,Cash\\,Flow}\\] The payback can be calculated in a simplified way – where the time value of money is not taken into account - or in a discounted way, where the net cash flows are calculated using the present cost (discounted payback period). Project evaluation should never be only based on the analysis of one single indicator. Only the combined analysis of all indicators will provide enough information to make a well-informed decision. 3.2.5 Accounting Equation What is the Basic Accounting Equation? \\[Assets = Liabilities + Owner&#39; s\\ Equity\\] Double entry bookkeeping and accounting are based on the basic accounting equation which states that the total assets of a business must equal the total liabilities plus the owner’s equity in the business. One side represents the assets of the business (buildings, inventory, vehicles etc.), and the other side represents how those assets were funded (capital, retained earnings, loans, supplier credit etc.). Notice that owners’ equity includes amounts invested by the owners (capital) and profits of the business which have been retained. The basic accounting equation is true at any point in time for business and is also true for each individual double entry transaction. For example, if the business buys PV System on credit from a supplier for 1000 then the basic accounting equation is shown as follows. Example \\(Assets = Liabilities + Equity\\) \\(PV \\ System = Accounts \\ payable + None\\) \\(1000 = 1000 + 0\\) The two sides of the basic accounting equation are equal. On one side is the PV System coming into the business as an asset, on the other side is the funding for the asset which in this case is credit from a supplier. 3.2.5.1 The Expanded Accounting Equation Since owners equity is made up of the capital injected and retained earnings of the business, the basic accounting equation can be expanded as follows: \\(Assets = Liabilities + Capital + Retained Earnings\\) In addition, retained earnings can be expanded to revenue less expenses less owners drawings, giving the fully expanded accounting equation shown below. \\(Assets = Liabilities + Capital + Revenue - Expenses - Drawings\\) It should also be noted that since revenue less expenses is equal to the net income of the business for the period the accounting equation can also be stated as follows. \\(Assets = Liabilities + Capital + Net\\ income - Drawings\\) The fully expanded accounting equation is summarized in the diagram below. The owner’s drawings represent cash taken out of the business by way of salary, in a company this would be represented by dividends paid to the equity owners. The expanded accounting equation effectively shows that retained earnings are the link between the balance sheet and the income statement. The income statement is, in fact, a further analysis of the equity of the business. 3.2.6 Financial Statements The relationship between financial statements can be seen by reviewing the basic trading operations of a business. The main financial statements are used to show different aspects of a business. It is important to understand the relationship between financial statements as this allows a full understanding of the financial performance of the business when analyzing financial statements The Four Financial Statements The 3 financial statements are as follows. Balance Sheet – The balance sheet or statement of financial position, shows a financial snapshot of the assets, liabilities and equity of the business at a specific point in time. Income Statement – The income statement shows the financial performance of the business over an accounting period in terms of its revenue, expenses, and net income. Cash Flow Statement – The cash flow statement or statement of cash flows shows the cash inflow and cash outflow of the business over an accounting period. (The is also the Statement of Retained Earnings that reconciles the beginning and ending retained earnings by adjusting for the net income and dividend distributions of the business, among other documents, e.g. inventory.) 3.2.7 The Relationship Between the Financial Statements The income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement are all interrelated. The income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement are all interrelated. The income statement describes how the assets and liabilities were used in the stated accounting period. The cash flow statement explains cash inflows and outflows, and it will ultimately reveal the amount of cash the company has on hand, which is also reported on the balance sheet. By themselves, each financial statement only provides a portion of the story of a company’s financial condition; together, they provide a complete picture. In the context of corporate financial reporting, the income statement summarises a company’s revenues (sales) and expenses, quarterly and annually for its fiscal year. The final net figure, as well as various other numbers in the statement, are of major interest to the investment community. The income statement (depending on each countries accounting rules), can be: Multi-Step Format Single-Step Format Net Sales Net Sales Cost of Sales Materials and Production Gross Income* Marketing and Administrative Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&amp;A) Research and Development Expenses (R&amp;D) Other Income &amp; Expenses Other Income &amp; Expenses Pretax Income Pretax Income* Taxes Taxes Net Income Net Income (after tax)* 3.3 Cash Flows 3.3.1 Nature As we mention, the cash flow is the net balance between positive and negative money flows in the project. When we are dealing with project evaluation we can split the money flows between costs and revenues, by nature in the following categories: Investment (value used to buy an asset required for the project) Operating (value used to operate the asset required for the project) Financing (The financing costs are related to how much is it necessary to finance activities) In the energy field, this is the investment necessary to increase energy savings (e.g. changing the lighting system or install a new monitoring system) or eventually to get some revenue (e.g. Installing a PV system that can back sell to the grid the excess) The cash flow is the net balance of all the revenues and costs, regardless of their nature (financing, operating or investment) In a project evaluation, it should always be positive, as it means that the revenues are larger than the expenses. 3.3.2 Fix costs and variable costs You also can be spilt by: Fix costs and variable costs. A variable cost and fixed cost are the two main costs a company has when producing goods and services. A company’s total cost is composed of its total fixed costs and its total variable costs. Variable costs vary with the amount produced. Fixed costs remain the same, no matter how much output a company produces. A variable cost is a company’s cost that is associated with the amount of goods or services it produces. A company’s variable cost increases and decreases with the production volume. For example, suppose company ABC produces light bulbs for a cost of €2 a light bulb. If the company produces 500 units, its variable cost will be €1,000. However, if the company does not produce any units, it will not have any variable cost for producing the light bulb. On the other hand, a fixed cost does not vary with the volume of production. A fixed cost does not change with the amount of goods or services a company produces. It remains the same even if no goods or services are produced. Using the same example above, suppose company ABC has a fixed cost of 10,000 per month for the machine it uses to produce light bulbs. If the company does not produce any light bulbs for the month, it would still have to pay 10,000 for the cost of renting the machine. On the other hand, if it produces 1 million light bulbs, its fixed cost remains the same. The variable costs change from zero to $2 million in this example. 3.3.3 Break even analysis We can relate Total Costs and its Fix and Variable Costs to answer a simple question: How many units do I have to sale to pay for the Fix Costs? Or to Breakeven? \\[Fixed \\ Costs ÷ (Price - Variable\\ Costs) = Breakeven\\ Point\\ in \\ Units\\] Where you divide the Fix Costs by the difference between Price and Variable Costs, that can also the Cost of Goods Sold, The result is the Breakeven Point in Units, meaning how many units you have to sell to pay for the fix Costs. If you look to the chart, you can see the BEP, or the equilibrium point of the Total revenues curve and Total Cost Curve, where any value on the left, mean that you are in loss region, and on the right profitable region. 3.3.4 Cash Flows in EE In energy efficiency, the cash flows have a special nature as they, in general, they do not represent a real money inflow to the company, but rather a smaller expense or outflow. When we implement an energy efficiency measure, we do not receive money for it (except in few cases, like selling electricity to the grid), but we spend less money on energy. Most will assume that savings, namely in EE projects are equal to future earnings (or a future stream of cash flows), but you should be aware that is not, namely: Savings means fewer costs, not more revenues; Means that unless you take those savings and invest in a similar project with a similar stream of cash flows, you can´t compound negative value (or for simplicity, assume that you can only compound values greater than 0). You will have to make payments in the future, namely if under a EPC Contract, so when looking to an EE investment you better consider as an investment, where you may have to pay something upfront the rest delayed in future payment and the future (after payment the investment) you will have to use fewer funds for energy. So you can consider as net flows of inflows and outflows of money, where EE measure will impact the outflows, still, if the outflows are 0 (you don’t spend any in energy, means that you will have 0 savings because there’s no efficiency to apply to outflows. 3.3.5 Investments A capital expenditure, or CAPEX, is considered an investment into the business. The money spent is not immediately reported on the income statement; rather, it is treated as an asset on the balance sheet. A CAPEX is deducted over the course of several years as a depreciation expense, beginning with the year following the purchase. The depreciation expense is reported on the income statement in the tax years it is deducted, resulting in reduced profit. Example: An owner of a flower shop and, in 2012, purchases a delivery van for € 30,000. The van is recorded as an asset on 2012’s balance sheet, leaving the income statement for 2012 unaffected by the purchase. You expect to use the van for six years, so it is depreciated by €5,000 each year. So, In 2013’s income statement, a $5,000 expense is then reported. While a CAPEX does not directly affect income statements in the year of purchase, for each subsequent year for the expected useful life of the asset the depreciation expense affects the income statement. A CAPEX may indirectly have an immediate effect on income statements depending on the type of asset that is acquired. Using the previous example, the van purchased for the flower shop is not recorded on the income statement for 2012, but gas and insurance expenses for the van are considered business expenses that affect the income statement. However, the expenses incurred by the van may be offset by the increase in revenue produced by the delivery van. A cash position represents the amount of cash that a company, investment fund or bank has on its books at a specific point in time. The cash position is a sign of financial strength and liquidity. In addition to cash itself, this position often takes into consideration highly liquid assets, such as certificates of deposit, short-term government debt and other cash equivalents. 3.3.6 Capital Structure Decisions The way you decide to finance the project (Capital Structure) plays a central role in Financial Analysis. You can use an opportunity cost analysis to help you decide how to best capitalise a project. A project’s capital structure is simply how a company finances its operations. The capital structure may involve a mix of long-term debt, short-term debt, and equity. Equity is the infusion of capital into a business through the sale of shares of common stock or preferred stock to investors. You can also use own company’s resources, as savings. What does the opportunity cost have to do with a business’s capital structure? If you finance your capital through debt, you have to pay it back even if you aren’t making any money. Moreover, money allocated to servicing debt can’t be spent on investing in the business or pursuing other investment opportunities. You can use an opportunity cost analysis to help you decide how to best capitalise a project. A project’s capital structure is simply how a company finances its operations. A capital structure may involve a mix of debt (long-term or short-term) and equity, and Equity, which is the infusion of capital into a business using the company’s resources, such as savings or through the sale of shares. 3.3.6.1 Leverage and impact on Balance Sheet If you finance your investment through debt, you have to pay it back even if you aren’t making any money. Moreover, money allocated to servicing debt can’t be spent on investing in the business or pursuing other investment opportunities. However, debt is considered to be a cost to a company, so can be deducted. Using equity means that the financing costs may be lower, but it may compromise liquidity in this or other projects. Additionally, remember that depending on the Energy Efficiency projects and the regulation of the country, some investments may have a positive fiscal Impact (e.g. tax abatement) or may give access to special credit. So in the end, the project evaluation should consider the advantages of different capital structures. 3.3.7 Fiscal Impact Depending on how the structure is an EE investment can have: Fiscal Impact of using: Debt(debt is considered a cost to a company, so can be deducted); Investment(also is possible to deduct, still depends on one fiscal regulation Also, you increase the risk of bankruptcy if you have a higher debt level. The cost of capital is not equal, meaning that you can use a weight the use of equity and debt. Example For example, the same 1000€ investment, if you funded 50% with debt, with 10%interest rate, meaning 50€, you can deduct these costs, so you would pay less corporate tax if your EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) due to this characteristic. A B Investment 1000€ 1000€ Equity 500€ 1000€ Debt 500€ 0€ Interest Rate 10% EBITDA 1000€ 1000€ Interest expenses (50€) 0 Taxable Income 950€ 1000€ Corporate Tax (25%) (237,5€) (250€) Net Income 762,5€ 750€ Observe this example to understand that the cost of capital is not equal, meaning that you can use a balance of equity and debt. For example the same 1000€ investment, the company may choose option A or option B. Option A considers that 50% of the investment is funded with debt, with 10% interest rate, while option B considers that the project is financed 100% by Equity (or own resources). In option A, it will be possible to deduct 50€ per year, but in option B this will not be possible because only interest is considered as a cost of Company. As a result, in option A the company will pay less tax (in this case 25% of EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). So, with option A, the company will have a higher Net Income (in this case of 12,5€ euros, compared to option B) due to the fiscal impact of debt. 3.4 Project Evaluation Now, look at this example of a project of installing a PV power plant in our facility. The investment in the power plant has an initial investment that will be done in year 0 (the present). We will be able to sell some electricity back to the grid, and for that, we will have some positive cash flow from sales, but there will be some operation and maintenance costs. We also need to ask for a loan to develop the project so that we will have some financing expenses throughout the years. In the end, the balance between the investment, and the sales from power plant minus the expenses in operating and financing will generate sufficient cash flows not only to payback the investment in 3 years, but also to generate additional earnings. Now, of course, this depends on the considered interest rate. One important aspect of project evaluation is to look to the evolution of cash flows and not only to the result (NPV, IRR or Payback Period). 3.4.1 Liquidity trap The pitfall of just looking to NPV and not to cash flows or to answer the simple question: Will I have enough funds to pay all committed obligations and? Do I have working capital to secure is any future earning is delayed lead companies to stressful situations. This is the liquidity trap, when you may have a great balance sheet will future revenues streams, but if you have few liquid resources for the short run, you may end in what is so-called “Financial Slack.” As a side effect, even if you can borrow money, your IRR will also be worse than forecast, and you will need more time to have the expected return on investment (that at this point you understand that also carries a cost). One of the most common traps is the liquidity trap than being framed as follows: What is worse? Owing 100€ tomorrow or 1 € today? Imagine company A that has 0€ today but will receive 100€ tomorrow. The problem is it has to make payments today so, technically could: ask for a loan(which carries costs) may be not able to secure such loan and technically would be bankrupt. The pitfall of just looking to NPV and not to cash flows or to answer the simple question: will I have enough funds to pay all committed obligations and? Do I have working capital to secure is any future earning is delayed lead companies to stressful situations? This is called the liquidity trap when your balance sheet with future revenues streams look good, but if you have few liquid resources for the short run, you may end by failing your duties. In this case, for example, if you need to borrow additional money, your NPV will also be worse than forecast, and you will need more time to have the expected return on investment. You already understand cash flows still there are some details you should consider: A Cash Flow is a stream of income (money) into or out of a business, project, or financial product measured during a specified, limited period. It corresponds to a stream of income, where can change if you increase sales, or price or increase or decrease costs, as savings. So when looking to a cash flow statement, We can see: Revenues of Sales, or how much money is coming in, Investment, meaning money spent on investments activities) Operations usually referred to as Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) and Financing. In green are all inflows of money, in red the outflows, so, breaking down per year, a typical investment, demands high capital investment in year 0 and if you don´t have, you may ask for a loan. So in year 0, you have a loan that goes to investment activities. In year 1 you will have inflows of money from sales, but you also have to pay for O&amp;M and financing activities. Lastly, if you notice, your IRR will go from a negative one to a positive one. As you may notice, if don´t have enough inflows of cash to pay for O&amp;M or Financing, you would end in a “negative” net cash flow position, meaning that you are not generating enough income to pay for your activities. Using again the same representation of Cash Flows and now imagine this planned cash flows. All seem ok, there is enough money to pay O&amp;M, financing activities and in year 5 IRR will be positive, meaning that you already repaid all financial investment. Coming back to the example of the PV System project, imagine that in Year 3, there is a stop in the production. Imagine you have a malfunction that had two consequences: Needed to spend more money on O&amp;M and you were not able to generate electricity, so you will have no sales in this year. How are going to pay for the financing activities? 3.5 EE metrics 3.5.1 Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) The LCOE Measures lifetime costs divided by energy production or: Calculates the present value of the total cost of building and operating a power plant over an assumed lifetime. Allows the comparison of different technologies (e.g., wind, solar, natural gas) of unequal lifespans, project size, different capital cost, risk, return, and capacities It is quite similar to the NPV formula, where: It is quite similar to the NPV formula, where: \\[LCOE = \\frac{sum \\ of \\ costs\\ \\ over \\ lifetime}{sum \\ of \\ eletrical\\ energy\\ produced \\ over \\ lifetime} = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{n}\\frac{I_t+M_t+F_t}{(1+r)^n}} {\\sum_{t=1}^{n}\\frac{E_t}{(1+r)^n}}\\] \\(I_t\\) = Investment expenditures in year t (including financing) \\(M_t\\) = Operations and maintenance expenditures in year t \\(F_t\\) = Fuel expenditures in year t \\(E_t\\) = Electricity generation in year t \\(r\\) = Discount rate \\(n\\) = Life of the system 3.5.1.1 Environmental costs If the fuel also releases \\(CO_2\\) you also have to consider (if industrial) the EU ETS Allowances (or other, depending on the countries regulation). Focusing on the variable cost, the CO2 main price driver is the “Fuel Switching cost” and coal forwards (coal releases more \\(CO_2\\)) and gas forwards, having a direct impact on power prices. The price dynamics in the emissions market is driven by the power sector. Inversely, projects that have positive environmental and/or climate benefits may benefit from special conditions and support, as, e.g. “Smart Finance for Smart Buildings initiative” approved this year by the EIB.17 3.5.1.2 Simple LCOE Concept For example for the PV System project, where it have a 1 y term (for simplicity), the LCOE would be: Simple LCOE Concept (1 year Lifetime) The Initial Costs Including Financing (100€), plus Annual Expenses (10€) (if you have more years, would be the projects O&amp;M), or 110€ of costs. Imagine that generates 1000kWh per year, so the costs of each would be 0.11€/kWh. In the end, it gives a metric of the cost of energy by implementing the projects, so the project with the lowest LCOE should in principle be more advantageous. For energy generation projects like PV Power plants, or energy savings project (like changing the lighting system), the LCOE is quite similar to the NPV formula and represents the ratio between the stream of cash Flows to generate the electricity (or saving electricity) during \\(n\\) years divided by the energy produced (or consumed) during that period. 3.5.1.3 Notes 3.5.1.3.1 Fundamentals If you look the numerator \\(sum \\ of \\ costs\\ \\ over \\ lifetime\\), you notice that has a similar formulation of the Present value, although, if you compared with other proxies that actually measure changes in prices (or increase in Costs or decrease in Costs for producers), we will get to Inflation. The inflation rate is widely calculated by calculating the movement or change in a price index, usually the consumer price index, as the consumer price index (CPI) measures changes in the price level of market basket (sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically) of consumer goods and services purchased by households. Sub-indices and sub-sub-indices are computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services, being combined to produce the overall index with weights reflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the index. It is one of several price indices calculated by most national statistical agencies. The annual percentage change in a CPI is used as a measure of inflation. A CPI can be used to index (i.e., adjust for the effect of inflation) the real value of wages, salaries, pensions, for regulating prices and for deflating monetary magnitudes to show changes in real values. In most countries, the CPI, along with the population census, is one of the most closely watched national economic statistics. \\[{\\displaystyle\\left( \\frac{CPI_{Year0} -CPI_{Year1}} {CPI_{Year0}}\\right) \\times 100\\%=Inflation \\ rate(\\%)}\\] To illustrate the method of calculation, in January 2007, the U.S. Consumer Price Index was 202.416, and in January 2008 it was 211.080. The formula for calculating the annual percentage rate inflation in the CPI over the course of the year is: \\[{\\displaystyle \\left({\\frac {211.080-202.416}{202.416}}\\right)\\times 100\\%=4.28\\%} \\] The resulting inflation rate for the CPI in this one-year period is 4.28%, meaning the general level of prices for typical U.S. consumers rose by approximately four percent in 2007. If you look at the denominator \\(sum \\ of \\ eletrical\\ energy\\ produced \\ over \\ lifetime\\), also applies the sale reasoning. If you look to other proxy used, the “degrading factor”, or the &quot; The ability to accurately predict power delivery over the course of time“, the rate is not geometric, where, taking for example” Typically, a 20% decline is considered a failure, but there is no consensus on the definition of failure, because a high-efficiency module degraded by 50% may still have a higher efficiency than a non-degraded module from a less efficient technology.&quot; Considering (for PV Modules) the degradation rate is between 0.2%/year to 4.2%/year, with average going from 0.7% to 0.8% and median of 0.5%, is quite different from assuming the behaviours used for time value.18 3.5.1.3.2 Application Increasing and decreasing the lifespan of equipment may change a lot results; Efficiency of equipment tends to decrease over time and use (meaning that in year 10, you may not be able to generate the same amount of year 1) If it relies on natural resources, you should be aware of intermittency of generation; O&amp;M may increase due to overuse of equipment 3.5.2 Cost-Optimaly Methodology The Cost-Optimaly Methodology gives all relevant definitions needed to make the cost-optimum calculations and analyses of the implementation of energy efficiency measures in buildings. It is defined as technologically neutral and does not favour one technological solution over another. It ensures a competition of measures/packages/ variants over the estimated lifetime of a building or building element”. 3.5.2.1 Calculation scheme according to CEN/TR 15615 (umbrella document).19 The global cost must be calculated according to EN15459 as indicated in the formula: \\[C_{g}(\\tau) = C_I \\sum{_j}[ \\sum_{i=1}^{\\tau}(C_{a,i(j)} \\cdot R_d(i)) - C_{f\\tau}(j)]\\] Where: \\(Cg(t)\\) are the Global costs referring to the starting year τ=0, \\(Cl\\) are the Initial investment costs, \\(Ca,i(j)\\) are the annual costs year i for energy-related component j (energy costs, operational costs, periodic or replacement costs, maintenance costs), \\(Rd(i)\\) is the discount rate for year i (depending on interest rate), \\(Vf,τ(j)\\) is the final value of component j at the end of the calculation period (referred to the starting year τ=0 ), The cost-optimum calculations are based on a net present value calculation. According to Boermans, Bettgenhäuser et al., 2011 ( Cost-optimal building performance requirements - Calculation methodology to report on national energy performance requirements on the basis of cost-optimality within the framework of the EPBD, eceee). When we discuss the cost-optimal levels and the effort to achieve energy savings, only the lower boundary of the cloud is interesting to identify the cost-optimal level. In the case of a flat cost-curve, it was suggested to set the requirements in the lower (left) part of the calculated cost-optimal points. This will ensure that the most energy-efficient solution sets are selected. On the other hand, one should also try to avoid going too far on the left side of the curve, as cost-curves often show a tendency of a steep increase in costs when moving to the far left. According to EN15459, the Cost optimal range: 3.5.2.2 Other metrics Assessing the Economic Value of New Utility-Scale Renewable Generation Projects Using Levelized Cost of Electricity and Levelized Avoided Cost of Electricity.20 3.6 Scenario and Risk Analysis 3.6.1 Risk and uncertainty When referring to risk, most relate to the idea of certainty (or the lack of it) and or high or low volatility. You understand that a deposit is safer than investing in the stock market. For the last, you will demand a higher return, or risk premium (usually is equal to risk-free rate plus a certain risk on top of that). The later carries higher risk, which could mean you could lose all you invested money (and more if you add some complex financial products). 3.6.2 Financial risk and operational risk It also refers to safety and reliability. In engineering usually, it is referred to risk as something you have to mitigate to guarantee a certain level or safety, efficiency or other parameter or, to have a safe gauge in the case that something fails. As a control system that may stop some tasks, send an alarm and so on. So you have financial risk and operational risk, referring to the implementation and operations of a certain investment. Other risks to take into consideration: Technical and operational risk; Regulatory risk; Market Risk; Financial Risk; Understanding risk means understanding exposure, or what type of events could change your basic underlying assumptions. As an example, if you run your projections assuming a certain amount of sales and a small change will set to unprofitability, so running several scenarios will help you understand how exposed you are to a change of the demanded volume. A change in regulation will set more companies working in the same space so setting cannibalism behaviours (as dumping); First, you start by acknowledging the event, then mitigate or (trying to) by different strategies. You may also choose to pursue the option in less probability of being exposed to a certain risk. 3.6.2.1 Finantial Risk Considering corporate finance, the risk is priced, usually by the Beta Coefficient of the CAPM model, that coupons the minimum return adjusted to risk and is priced as follows: The SML graphs the results from the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) formula (\\(CAPM = R_f + \\beta \\times R_m\\) and \\(\\beta=R_f+(r_m−r_f)\\)) The x-axis represents the risk (beta), and the y-axis represents the expected return. The market risk premium is determined from the slope of the SML. The relationship between β and the required return is plotted on the security market line (SML) which shows expected return as a function of β. The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate Rf available for the market, while the slope is E(Rm)−Rf(for market return Rm). The security market line can be regarded as representing a single-factor model of the asset price, where beta is exposure to changes in the value of the market. The equation of the SML, giving the expected value of the return on asset i, is thus: It is a useful tool in determining if an asset being considered for a portfolio offers a reasonable expected return for risk. Individual securities are plotted on the SML graph. If the security’s risk versus expected return is plotted above the SML, it is undervalued because the investor can expect a greater return for the inherent risk. Security plotted below the SML is overvalued because the investor would be accepting a lower return for the amount of risk assumed. 3.6.2.2 Operational risk One of the most common ones relies on technical and operational risk, or how often projects access that the initial parameters still hold. A basic example can be described as follows: Certain manufacturer states stat certain equipment works for a determined use and need repairs and maintenance every x year of another parameter. Project managers want to “maximise profit, and it’s being working fine until now, nothing seems wrong” so will save a few Euros and delaying replacement of some fundamental pieces or maintenance and looks great on the financial documents. Until a certain day where either has a huge accident or the systems breaks. It’s the typical fat tail risk where from previous observations, everything will look “average”… in historical data. If you discard that some things will not decrease efficiency, just go from one state to other, because reached a breaking point (or change of state). 3.6.3 Due diligence Due diligence is verifying that all statements are true, this means verifying all assumptions prior and then you should have proper compliance mechanism to avoid having a misrepresentation of the facts. Projects are run by humans and humans (and machines) make errors, so you always should have systems to track errors, not dependent on a single person. This is why you order audits to third parties which have 2 effects: People will perform differently in they know someone else will verifying; If more than one person or entity will check the project, you will have a lower probability of missing some critical elements or information. Narrowed Due diligence so as corporate governance structure can mitigate opportunist behaviours, misrepresentation of facts or important element important to make any investment decision. 3.6.4 Externalities Finally, you can also consider other metrics, as environment impact (as carbon footprint) and social impact in these projects. So you also can incorporate on the initial goals so as quantifying such metrics so as risks. 3.6.5 Project evaluation steps Identify service need and define objectives and scope Identify options to accomplish the objectives Narrow down the options Do the economic and financial analysis of the different options Identify benefits (avoided costs and saving costs) Identify investment and operation costs Evaluate net benefits Due risk analysis and sensitivity analysis Rank and choose the best option 3.6.5.1 Notes on Excel and other tools NPV function in spreadsheets doesn’t really calculate NPV. Instead, despite the word “net,” the NPV function is really just a present value of uneven cash flow function. Net present value is defined as the present value of the expected future cash flows less the initial cost of the investment. “Net” always means that something has been subtracted. In any case, there are two common ways to calculate the real NPV in Excel: Use the NPV function, but leave out the initial outlay. Then, outside of the NPV function, subtract the IO. (Note, the initial outlay is often entered as a negative number, so it will actually be added.) Use the NPV function and include the initial outlay in the range of cash flows. In this case, the “NPV” will be in the period -1 so we must bring it forward one period in time. So, multiply the result by (1 + i), where i is the per period discount rate. For IRR, you may use “goal seek” function. If using the IRR (or MIRR), the formula also discounts investment at \\(t^{-1}\\), so you should apply the same step referred on point 2 to bring forward to \\(t_0\\) https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/financing-energy-efficiency or other examples of EFSI projects in the energy sector, url: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment/investment-plan-europe-juncker-plan/investment-plan-results/efsi-energy-sector_en#examplesofefsiprojectsintheenergysector).↩ Cf.

Most contracts are designed to answer a specific need or problem. When we refer to a contract, on a very simples terms we mean: An agreement with specific terms between two or more persons or entities in which there is a promise to do something in return for a valuable benefit (or consideration, in common law) The existence of a contract requires finding the following factual elements: an offer; an acceptance of that offer which results in a meeting of the minds (also referred to as “the mirror image rule”); a promise to perform; a valuable consideration (which can be a promise or payment in some form); a time or event when performance must be made (or also referred to as meet commitments); the terms and conditions for performance, including fulfilling promises; performance, and an intention to affect legal obligations (so we are excluding what doctrine refers to “not a serious proposal” too) Depending on how the deal is structured, performance and its payment can be designed differently. Usually are dragged along the whole term of the contract (not a single performance and payment), namely if there are several instalments instead of a single payment or, it´s a recurrent service. 4.1.0.1 Contract elements Performance Payment Exchange (product /service) for a Price Terms and conditions The total energy used (not useful) can be expressed as to how we use energy services, or secondary conversation that concerts to heating, ventilation, lighting and so on. Bear in mind, that energy supply and energy performance are not equivalents. Contracting a certain amount of energy and end use are not equals. Besides losses with secondary conversion, the first is related to a commodity (or raw material you buy to generate a certain output), the last to the end result. The same amount of energy may give the same thermal comfort, or not, for example. Energy contracts Energy Supply Contract Energy Services Agreement (ESA) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) Energy Performance Contract (EPC) Energy Management Contract (EMC) Finally, to have a Contract you need, at least two persons or entities. The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) defines an ‘energy service provider’ as a “natural or legal person who delivers energy services or other energy efficiency improvement measures in a final customer’s facility or premises”. They can be (alone or jointly): Utilities; Equipment manufacture/supplier; Supplier Manufacturer of building automation and control systems Facility management and operation company Consulting/engineering firm Independent specialist (focused on Energy efficiency services); Energy Data Companies; Governmental entities (namely under subsidized schemes) Banks and other Financial institutions (as intermediaries for EE related type of investments) and Others. In a raw sense, you should understand that entity will not define the contract, meaning that an EPC will be an EPC, regardless if it is specially used by one type of Entity (a typical example of EE contracts with the Public Sector). Also, you can have a variety of entities so understanding the responsibility, strengths and weaknesses and governance among them is an important matter. The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) defines an ‘energy service provider’ as a “natural or legal person who delivers energy services or other energy efficiency improvement measures in a final customer’s facility or premises”. 4.2 Energy Services Contracts (ESA´s) An Energy Service Agreement or Contract its use with a large range of scopes. As it is defined by Lay and Sorrell, Energy service contracts have been variously defined and categorised in relation to the nature of the energy services covered such as: the source of finance for new investment; the ownership of the relevant assets; the provision of guarantees for savings in energy; consumption and/or costs and; the degree to which control of energy services together with the associated risks is transferred to the contractor. Various definitions of energy service contracting have been proposed, but few satisfactorily describe the diversity of contractual arrangements that are available or the range of activities involved. There is little consensus on which combination of these distinguishes energy service contracts from more conventional (namely under one single market supplier, or a monopoly) or market relationships (as energy/fuel supply Contracts under liberalised market). Terminology use varies from one country to another, reflecting Financial and Fiscal schemes which aim to promote EE measures and, as a result, the types of contract change in line with those policies. There are several configurations of energy services contracts, most specific to each country. To name a few, so you can analyse the range of contractual terms that can be under the “energy service Contract”´ terminology. “Delivery Contracting” - also known as Supply Contracting or Energy Supply Contracting (ESC) - is focused on the supply of a set of energy services (such as heating, lighting, motive power, etc.) mainly via outsourcing the energy supply. Chauffage, one of the most common contract types in Europe besides EPC, is a form of Delivery Contracting. In a chauffage arrangement, the fee for the services is normally calculated based on the client’s existing energy bill minus a certain level of (monetary) savings, with a guarantee of the service provided. Alternatively, the customer may pay a rate, for instance, per square meter. The ESCO (or ESPC) may also take over the purchase of fuel and electricity. A Contract Energy Management (CEM), which means “the managing of some aspects of a client’s energy use under a contract that transfers some of the risk from the client to the contractor (usually based on providing agreed ‘service’ levels)” “comfort contracting” In the Nordic countries/Scandinavia, contracts similar to Delivery Contracting are referred to as “comfort contracting”, and in these contracts, the provision of the level of comfort or level of service is outsourced to the ESCO firm. These contracts will go beyond the provision of energy for the level of comfort and take care of full maintenance, including a healthy indoor environment, aesthetics, etc. “heat supply contracts” In Italy, “chauffage”, or “heat supply contracts” (“Servizio Calore”, in Italian). These are however substituted by the stricter “Energy Service Plus contracts” (“Servizio Energia plus”), which also includes a commitment by the provider to reduce the consumption of primary energy for winter heating by at least 10% with respect to what is indicated in the building certificate. Furthermore, it commits to the installation of a temperature control system, when possible. A BOOT model involves an ESCO designing, building, financing, owning and operating the equipment for a defined period of time and then transferring this ownership across to the client. This model resembles a special purpose enterprise created for a particular project. Clients enter into long-term supply contracts with the BOOT operator and are charged accordingly for the service delivered; the service charge includes capital and operating cost recovery and project profit. Integrated Energy Contracting (IEC) is a new model, which combines “Engineering, Procurement, and Construction” (EPC) Contract and Delivery Contracting and thus increase the amount of energy cost savings. When designing the project, demand-side measures are planned as a priority, and the remaining level of energy needs are covered by more energy efficient supply, when possible. Therefore an IEC combines the benefits of the demand and supply side measures, there forereaching a higher cost-benefit. At the same time, the contract is simpler than a normal EPC, which also reduces expenses. Utility energy service Contracts (UESC) were initially Authorized by the Energy Policy Act. A utility energy service contract (UESC) is a limited-source contract between a federal agency and its serving utility for energy- and water-efficiency improvements and demand-reduction services. Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs), also known as Energy Performance Contracts (EPC), originally from the US, are an alternative financing mechanism designed to accelerate investment in cost-effective energy conservation measures in existing Federal buildings. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) authorised Federal agencies to use private sector financing to implement energy conservation methods and energy efficiency technologies. An ESPC is a partnership between a Federal agency and an energy service company (ESCO). The ESCO conducts a comprehensive energy audit for the Federal facility and identifies improvements to save energy. In consultation with the Federal agency, the ESCO designs and constructs a project that meets the agency’s needs and arranges the necessary financing. The ESCO guarantees that the improvements will generate energy cost savings sufficient to pay for the project over the term of the contract. After the contract ends, all additional cost savings accrue to the agency. The Energy Services Agreement services offer may be, alone or as a combination of: Energy analysis and audits; Project identification and appraisal; Project design and implementation Energy management Property/facility management Monitoring and evaluation of savings Maintenance and operation Equipment supply Provision of services (space heating/cooling, lighting, etc.). Fuel or electricity supply Project financing and Others. Depending on the final setup, the contractual terms offered may be presented as: Project financing; Delivery contracting; BOOT (Building-Own-Operate-Transfer); Guarantee of performance; Shared savings (EPC) or Guaranteed savings (EPC) Insurance coverage (insurance policy against events that can imply financial penalties for the ESCO) and Others. You can think of a set of services, products, including construction being provided by one or more entities under a certain contractual arrangement. This combination depends on your needs, your present and future resources, as income and the final agreed structure. We are going to cover some of the most relevant issues covered by the terms of an energy service contract. Remember that most of the times are contracts with a long period of time, so its term may be subjected to several changes or events during the period of the contract. When we refer to new equipment (for example, new heating or cooling system, PV system) that needs to be installed you should be aware of: Specification, selection, cost, responsibility for installation and commissioning Depending on the terms offered, this equipment can be owned by the beneficiary of such EE measures or not. When referring “Equipment ownership” and along with it comes the definition of rights during and after contract, buyback provisions As an example, you need a car to get to work. You either decide to buy one. If you don´t have enough capital to pay upfront, you can either ask for a loan (but the car it´s yours, so as the risk) or, you can make a leasing contract, where you can use the car, but the ownership of the car remains in the leasing company. At the end of the leasing Contract, you can buy the car for a residual price or not. Maintenance, means who is accountable for monitoring and maintenance a certain equipment if it’s a shared responsibility of not. You may have two sets of maintenance duties: preventive and corrective. Operation, or who is responsible for operating or how coordination is defined Performance and quality standards - May range from pressure and temperature in the case of steam supply to complex mix of comfort standards in the case of building energy services (e.g. temperature, lighting levels, air exchange, user control) Reliability standards - Maximum downtime, provisions for immediate and backup service in the event of malfunction Service standards - Acceptable parameters for temperature, lighting, air exchange and other factors Monitoring and verification - Methods for monitoring and verifying energy provision, consumption and savings, including the use of standardised protocols Calculation of cost savings - Baseline energy consumption and operating conditions, assumptions, formulas, adjustment protocols Pricing and payment provisions - Fixed and variable components of pricing, guarantees to the client, division of savings Adjustment to external changes - Adjustment to inflation, changes in energy prices and other factors Provisions for early termination - Buyout provisions, compensation, equipment removal provisions, restoration of facility Other - Insurance, dispute resolution, penalties for contract breach, force majeure, etc. As you already may notice, monitoring plays a central role in an energy service Contract, besides typical issues related to equipment installation, bear in mind that the premise to install new equipment relies on the promise of future savings. Usually, most disputes are related to the fulfillment , or not, that a certain service, was executed in accordance with the agreed terms, or usually disputes emerge on clauses related to how payments and saving are calculated, if a certain service was provided within a certain quality standard, if something needs to be repaired or replaced, who has the duty to repair, replace (and pay).. and so on. 4.2.1 Further references ESCO´s database (JCR) https://e3p.jrc.ec.europa.eu/communities/energy-service-companies European Energy Efficiency Platform https://e3p.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ 4.3 Energy Performance Contract (EPC) An ‘energy performance contracting’ means a contractual arrangement between the beneficiary and the provider of an energy efficiency improvement measure, verified and monitored during the whole term of the contract, where investments (work, supply or service) in that measure are paid for in relation to a contractually agreed level of energy efficiency improvement or other agreed energy performance criterion, such as financial savings;” The EPC proposal can be designed as follows: Baseline Energy Costs its done to access investment need to implement EE measures. After implementation of such measure the company will pay less energy cost, but has to pay back the ESE company pack, at least until refunded the initial investment; Depending on the terms, these savings may be guaranteed or shared; After the term of the contract, the company will still benefit from such measures but will save the whole saved energy costs. So when looking at the Contract Lifecycle, starting from left to right: Contract Lifecycle There is an initial assessment or audit; then A proposal with the Energy Efficiency Measures, Savings and General terms; An acceptance of such offer; (or not, and goes back to the proposal until you are satisfied with an offer); then the Investment and Implementation and lastly; Operation and Maintenance of the Energy Efficiency measures. One of the most critical features, when analysing such proposals is to understand if it is: Is a Guarantee performance or best efforts to get a certain performance? The first, guarantees, the last just makes a promise to make the best efforts. It may sound like the same things but is not. The promise on the first carries more certainty and commitment Depending on the contractual terms it may have: Shared Savings and the risk and benefit of such saving is spit among the parties, Assessment or results (or Monitoring and verification) plays a central role in this type of contract because completion and fulfilment of a certain performance rely on Monitoring and verification. Industry uses international standards to define what “Guarantee of energy efficiency improvement” is. In the EN 15900:2010 define as ”commitment of the service provider to achieve a quantified energy efficiency improvement”. The European standard EN 15900:2010 defines energy efficiency services (EES) as an agreed task or tasks designed to lead to an energy efficiency improvement and other agreed performance criteria. According to EN 15900:2010 EES shall include an energy audit (identification and selection of actions) as well as the implementation of actions and the measurement and verification of energy savings. A documented description of the proposed or agreed framework for the actions and the follow-up procedure shall be provided. The improvement of energy efficiency shall be measured and verified over a contractually defined period of time through contractually agreed methods. A core element of each EES is thus an energy efficiency improvement (EEI) action, which is any action that directly leads to a reduction in energy consumption. EEI actions may be the substitution of technology, improvement of technology, better use of technology, and behavioural change. Like most of the Typical Energy services Contracts, the Terms and Conditions of an EPC are quite similar. An EPC usually carries: Investment (also referred to as CAPEX) + O&amp;M (usually there is some bundling, depending on the amortisation of the CAPEX during O&amp;M); Or you can think of a typical Engineering and construction Contract with a Services Contract to perform O&amp;M. Regarding the overall EPC (you should be aware of who is carrying the risk, usually falls into who has the ownership of such investment); Are usually defined as well: Guarantees and Maintenance (i.e. if are included or not, etc.); Savings (results or best efforts?) - saving: kWh or final bill or, a combination of those? Verification and Audits (initial assessment and during the contract); Payments (how there are calculated, due dates, etc.); Provisions and scenarios that should be considered when designing the EPC ( or do the national legal system has a solution to these and some provisions should be added to the agreement) like: Changes (from initial assessment), of energy source, supplier, etc.; Price change (namely under liberalized market) and dynamic pricing (it can also be a form of savings, namely financial ones) Base scenario change: i.e. machinery, higher consumption. (long duration (due to a big payback time, around 5-8 years, you may want to considerer); Change of ownership (in Portugal, this type may be obligations “propter rem”, meaning that they are attached to the asset, not the person. If someone sells the asset, for example, a house, the debts may stay with it (for example due condominium bills..); Change of circumstances (usually there is some price increase, annually, according to some Price Index, still if i.e. electricity prices increase more than what could be expected, depending on jurisdiction parties may have to right to change pricing (i.e. for consumer, the supplier may have a right to unilaterally change pricing but has to give the right to step out too. This could impact the savings´ calculation or other terms that use this variable; Inclusions and exclusions (as. maximum number of support hours, replacements (for example, something is damaged and needs replacement); Integration with different suppliers (i.e. gas and electricity); Authorizations (passive or active management) – that could be in the form of a mandate to act on behalf of the final client, for example, to negotiate energy supply contracts) Controls and minimum services (what are the minimum services, for example in case of interruption of services (not related to energy supply), time to reestablish services, penalties, etc.); Breach of contract (remedies) Early Termination (of the contract) Other duties: as confidentially (may follow into “sensitive data” category, if you are dealing with households and using consumption profiles, you also have to be aware of that historical data of end users, has special duties and obligations) You also have the typical Events of Default, similar to an energy service contract such as: Typical Events of Default: Failure to make payments; Failure to maintain credit support; Breach of reps and warranties (usually subject to materiality); Breach of transfer/change of control restrictions; Other material breaches of obligations; Where there are Notices and opportunity to cure remediable breaches and Typical remedies can range from : Actual damages, subject to mitigation and capped Termination Termination payment Step-In-Rights for lenders in case of a default event 4.3.1 Templates and Models Energy Performance Contract (EPC): contract guidance note and model contract (UK) https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-performance-contract-epc Model Documents for an Energy Savings Performance Contract Project (DOE/US) https://energy.gov/eere/slsc/model-documents-energy-savings-performance-contract-project Model Energy Savings Performance Contract, Schedules, and Exhibits (DOE/US) https://energy.gov/eere/slsc/downloads/model-energy-savings-performance-contract-schedules-and-exhibits Other JCR Europe https://e3p.jrc.ec.europa.eu/articles/energy-performance-contracting https://database.aceee.org/state/energy-savings-performance 4.4 Power Purchase Agreement (PPA´s) A power purchase agreement (PPA), or electricity power agreement, is a contract between two parties, one which generates electricity (the seller) and one which is looking to purchase electricity (the buyer). The PPA defines all of the commercial terms for the sale of electricity - it can be fixed, indexed or “shaped”- between the two parties, including when the project will begin commercial operation, the schedule for delivery of electricity, penalties for under delivery, payment terms, and termination. A PPA is the principal agreement that defines the revenue and credit quality of a generating project and is thus a key instrument of project finance. This differs from the traditional approach of simply buying electricity from licensed electricity suppliers, often known as utility (or wholesale) PPAs. PPA also is a way of choosing a certain type of energy, the most common example, if a company wants to achieve a certain percentage of renewables (or decrease its carbon footprint) to either improve overall rating of its assets (from real estate to overall company), doing a PPA with solar or wind farm is a way to achieve that goal. There are several Business Models Involving PPAs We can have: On-site sale Direct sale to customer on site (shopping centres, commercial centres, manufacturing industry, airports, ports etc.) Saves costs related to the use of the transmission grid (transmission, distribution, dispatching, general costs of system) Sale through the grid Utility scale ground-mounted plants; Sale to energy utilities (peak load purchases, renewable energy source obligations); Sale to end users (large industrial clients); Sale to wholesalers or “aggregators”; There are several Power Purchase Agreement structures, namely: 4.4.0.0.1 Wholesale PPA The most simple PPA is the “Wholesale model”, where the generator sells all power supplied back to the grid. Most of the RES was implemented using this structure, where licenses were auctioned to generate a certain amount of energy in exchange for a certain predefined tariff per MWh. 4.4.0.0.2 Onsite direct wire PPA Not all PPA are wholesale PPA´s, and increasingly we see more often onsite private wire PPA´s. Instead of selling all back to the grid, namely activities that are energy intensive, as running servers of a company, or, they want to improve the % of RES in their overall energy mix, they can have power directly from generator to them and, a separate PPA, for either the excess power produced or as a last resort supplier. 4.4.0.0.3 Sleeved off-site PPA In a Sleeved PPA, all power generated is sold by the corporate consumer to the licensed supplier – or balancing party – still is a Back to back PPA – Electricity Supplier purchases all power purchased by the consumer. Consumer repurchases power it uses (performing balancing function). 4.4.0.0.4 Synthetic PPA A Synthetic PPA or, also referred as to a “Virtual PPA” is a Contract (e.g. hedge or Contract for Difference) where Generator receives market price under PPA and Generator and Consumer settle the difference between market price and fixed price. It is virtual, because there is no physical purchased of electricity, like most Contract for Difference. If you already looked to commodities trading (as brent, for example), you see that most have “financial settlement and not a physical settlement. 4.4.0.0.5 Mini-utility 4.4.1 Curtailments There are what so-called Default provisions related to Curtailments Illustration of wind/solar peaks and the curtailment potential 4.4.1.1 On the Buyer-Directed Curtailment: Buyer may have the right to direct Seller to decrease or stop deliveries Generally for economic reasons Seller should be compensated Make sure the Project is capable of complying 4.4.1.2 Third-Party Curtailment: Interconnecting Utility or Transmission Provider Broad curtailment rights in Interconnection Agreement – e.g. emergency, reliability, system maintenance Frequency may depend on level of transmission service Seller may or may not be compensated 4.4.1.3 Curtailments can be Compensated or not, where: 4.4.1.3.1 On the Compensated Curtailments: Contract Price for each MWh Seller could have delivered Plus, if applicable, value of lost benefits, grossed up for taxes 4.4.1.3.2 Or Non-Compensated Curtailments: Big negotiation point and financing issue Seller wants to maximise the ability to get compensated – argument is that anything affecting transmission beyond the Point of Delivery (POD) is Buyer’s risk no compensation for an “Emergency” – Buyer treats this as a force majeure; definition is important Generally no compensation if curtailment results from Seller’s failure to maintain required permits or interconnection facilities at or prior to the Point of Delivery (POD) Mechanics depend on market rules and Project specifics Be careful if Buyer is also the Transmission Provider or Interconnecting Utility 4.4.2 Templates 4.4.2.1 World Bank: https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sector/energy/energy-power-agreements/power-purchase-agreements 4.4.2.2 DOE (US) https://energy.gov/eere/femp/federal-site-renewable-power-purchase-agreements 4.5 Energy Management Contracts (EMC) 4.5.1 Why Assuming that there will be more granularity of data and more frequently, it will more common to contract actively energy management (such as active portfolio management). These contracts may be similar to those of O&amp;M of an EPC, but do not involve investment, nor is there any guarantee of savings. These can be of active management (in legal it is spoken in mandates). Another potential contract that aims to active manage someone’s energy on their behalf. So we will reference what this contract may look like and the importance of energy data, namely access to perform such obligations. Depends on the extension and type of service agreed, they can take the shape of: Active and Passive Management Energy Conservation Contracts Demand Side Management Data Access and Management 4.5.2 Mandate and authorisations What is to manage on behalf of one-third party? To manage on behalf (or to deliver the management to a third party).In simple terms is to make decisions on someone behalf that will affect their legal rights and duties or, you are substituting someone (or a company) to make de such decision, this may include: negotiate terms and conditions of a given contract; to perform certain duties; to make payments, etc One the most important thing is the extent of such mandate (or limit), where for certain acts (usually out of this scope) may demand more formalities. Also, you must take note: you are performing in the best interest of a third party; you should report on the activities taken on their behalf; if you are going to make payments on their behalf always slip what where the expenses taken from your fees and separate such items. Definition of mandate contract With representation Without representation Types: ‘contracts of mandate’; contracts to perform a specified task or work; and ‘contracts of management’. A classic contract of mandate does not concern the performance of work but the performance of an action for the benefit of someone else. In practice, contracts of the mandate are usually concluded as contracts for the performance of services, on whose basis the ‘mandator’ commissions the ‘mandatary’ to perform a certain action. Contract to perform a specified task or work There are more differences between the contract to perform a specified task or work and the contract of employment than in the case of the contract of mandate. First, the person performing the task or work is not subordinated to the ‘orderer’ (a mandatary is sometimes obliged to observe the instructions of the mandator). Second, it is a so-called ‘contract for result’, which means that its objective is the performance of a given task or work rather than the performance of the work itself. 4.5.3 Management Contract The term ‘contract of management’ may be used in both cases, but it usually refers primarily to civil law contracts for the performance of services. A classic contract of management is a so-called ‘innominate contract’ (i.e. a contract which is not separately regulated by the Civil Code) which specifies the conditions of performing services (e.g. managing a firm) by a manager. Since such a contract is based on the mandate model, Civil Code regulations concerning mandates apply. Example Active Energy Manager to monitor and manage the power and cooling needs. Systems can also be monitored using metering products, such as power distribution units (PDU), sensors, and integration with facility software. 4.5.4 Types of services: Monitoring power consumption data Collecting power consumption data Managing power, which includes: Setting power savings options Setting power caps Automating power-related tasks Configuring metering devices, such as PDUs and sensors Exporting data Viewing events Calculating energy cost Calculating estimated energy savings Setting thresholds Creating and setting power policies Does it make a difference if it is a human or not? If it is a human or algorithm to make the choices, it is irrelevant. If it is human to push the button or to draw a system of rules, in the last resource is always the human, that is the understanding), for the verification. With the introduction of dynamic pricing, it will be more relevant. 4.5.4.1 Data Access and Management Main elements to take into consideration: Energy data (definition) Access to energy data and benchmarking Energy profiles Standards and Interoperability Data security and privacy Data storage and portability Ownership (Copyright exception) 4.5.5 Role of Data energy Companies When managing energy a central issue is access to the reading used from energy billing, so you must know: time to give such data; time to ask rectifications what elements do you need The role of the ORD 4.5.5.1 Algorithmic decision making and other decision processes Regarding the model: Rule-based Case-based Regarding the underlying assumptions can: Deterministic Uncertainty 4.5.5.2 Bundling with IT services “as it is clauses”; Pricing on response time (availability rather than quantity); benchmarking (what is really good or bad management on behalf of the third party? Contracts, for example, from Amazon SW3, always have “as it is” clauses, like who wants to be guaranteed that they always have paid access more, that is, what should happen is that they give priority to these calls “power contracted”). As the cloud is things hosted on their servers. 4.5.6 Other There are protocols and initiatives like: The Green Button initiative is an industry-led effort that responds to a 2012 White House call-to-action to provide utility customers with easy and secure access to their energy usage information in a consumer-friendly and computer-friendly format for electricity, natural gas, and water usage.&quot; url: http://www.greenbuttondata.org/ 4.5.7 Models (templates) EPC Facility Management Model Contract, Integrating Energy Management in comprehensive Facility Management Service tenders (Austrian Energy Agency in cooperation with the Energy Agency Graz and the Energy Agency Berlin) https://ec.europa.eu/energy/intelligent/projects/sites/iee-projects/files/projects/documents/eurocontract_epc_facility_management_model_contract_en.pdf Agreement Template for Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management Services (DOE/US) https://energy.gov/eere/femp/downloads/agreement-template-energy-conservation-and-demand-side-management-services 4.5.8 EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Bear in mind that energy data belongs to the company and you may be using to extract consumption patterns (like when is most used a certain service), you have to consider the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you are doing also profiling, for example for comparison, make sure to not “personal data.” GDPR requires robust, centralised systems to handle even the most basic of customer information. Businesses will need to get data records in order, understand what has been stored, and how different departments are using customer data. They will also a need to maintain a strong audit trail of permissions that customers have given for the use of their data, and how this information flows through an organisation, to be able to fulfil the key principles set out in the regulation. The GDPR: Applies to all companies, inside or outside the EU, that target or monitor EU individuals or provide services into the EU Enforces fines of up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover, whichever is greater Imposes a 72-hour window for companies to report a breach if there is risk to affected individuals States that where an individual’s consent is deemed necessary for the processing of data, that consent must be unambiguous and informed Affords individuals the ‘right to be forgotten’ in certain cases and enhanced rights of access to their personal data Implements ‘privacy by design’ – privacy can no longer be an afterthought to operations Applies a more prescriptive statutory regime to data processors Sets up a ‘one stop shop’ – companies only have to register with one data protection agency Requires some companies who systematically process data to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) ‘data portability’ requirement that stipulates that data can be transferred to a new ‘controller’ at the request of the ‘subject’. When switching energy supplier, a customer can request that all data held on them by their original provider be transferred to the new one and that any record of that data then be forgotten. To meet these requirements companies will need to become more versatile and able to share and compartmentalise data more efficiently. This will open up opportunities to use data to improve customer communication. For instance, combining usage data from smart meters with a customer’s postcode might enable the company to provide them with geographically relevant information on the most cost-effective times to turn their heating on. Equally, in-home sensors could provide early warnings of when equipment develops a fault or is operating inefficiently. Having robust IT infrastructure and data systems to back this up will be needed to give firms the back-office muscle needed to proactively communicate this information with customers in meaningful, simple and relevant ways. 4.5.8.1 Refences: EC webpage: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation): http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679 4.6 Other (Distributed models) By compensation E.ON Cloud proposal by compensation, tokens (virtual credits); In Germany, in which it is basically a clearing account (a type of the bank or the one called “jumbo accounts”) with tokens, reminiscent of ethereum. 4.6.1 Blockchain as register/clearance/DB General Description of smart Contracts “A smart contract is an automatable and enforceable agreement. Automatable by computer, although some parts may require human input and control. Enforceable either by legal enforcement of rights and obligations or via tamper-proof execution of computer code.”21 Using ethereum example (token)22 contract token { mapping (address =&gt; uint) public coinBalanceOf; event CoinTransfer(address sender, address receiver, uint amount); /* Initializes contract with initial supply tokens to the creator of the contract */ function token(uint supply) { coinBalanceOf[msg.sender] = supply; } /* Very simple trade function */ function sendCoin(address receiver, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) { if (coinBalanceOf[msg.sender] &lt; amount) return false; coinBalanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount; coinBalanceOf[receiver] += amount; CoinTransfer(msg.sender, receiver, amount); return true; } } “it is a contract that generates 10 thousand tokens to the creator of the contract, and then allows anyone with enough balance to send it to others. These tokens are the minimum tradeable unit and cannot be subdivided, but for the final users could be presented as a 100 units subdividable by 100 subunits, so owning a single token would represent having 0.01% of the total. If your application needs more fine grained atomic divisibility, then just increase the initial issuance amount. In this example we declared the variable “coinBalanceOf” to be public, this will automatically create a function that checks any account’s balance.&quot; In general, they have these features: pre-written logic rules (in computer code), stored and replicated on a distributed ledger (e.g. a blockchain), executed/run by a network of computers (usually the same ones running the blockchain), can result in ledger updates (cryptocurrency payments, etc). In other words, they are small programs that execute “if this happens then do that”, run and verified by a network of computers to ensure trustworthiness. Is it really different from this ?

First, whereas a traditional contract is an inert text (or even a mere oral communication) and execution relies on the independent action of the parties, a smart contract is capable of at least partial performance by computers, without the parties’ direct intervention. Second, the enforceability of a smart contract can be of two types: either of the traditional legal kind (i.e. a court could enforce it) or of a new kind – tamper-proof execution of computer code. The use of the expression “tamper-proof” reflects the definition’s indebtedness to the aforementioned blockchain technologies, which are fundamentally a way of creating tamper-proof electronic record of transactions – i.e. a record which neither the parties nor any third party can modify. Registration, similarly, by its structure and logic, of a sequential order of events related to a given asset (namely ownership, mortgages, pledges, etc.) shares common traits (namely for third parties, cannot be more than one person with the title). Is this a contract (in legal terms)? Depending on the jurisdiction and the inserted code, de example supra that not constitute a contract. There’s no exchange (check the initial definition) we could say its a unilateral act (where A creates a “token”, for example when a company issues stock, it is not the same as A sell to B \\(x\\) number of stocks). What the definition is getting at here is that the enforceability of a smart contract may not necessarily lie in the fact that the output (i.e. its performance) can be enforced by a court, but, as an alternative sense of “enforceable”, that it may be effected by an autonomous technological process which, once initiated, cannot be interfered with. If I put a coin into a vending machine slot and enter a valid selection, there should be no requirement for the vendor to step in to ensure that the transaction is performed (the delivery of a can of soda) – it should be autonomous; and no further ability of the vendor to interfere with its consummation – it should be tamper-proof. If I submit a valid Bitcoin transfer instruction, the transaction is recorded autonomously on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the blockchain is not further modified until a subsequent valid transaction is entered into. Similarly, a smart contract solution, to have the property of tamper-proof execution, would have to be capable of ensuring its performance in such a way that it depends only on the completion of an autonomous technological process. Legal enforceability trumps mere performance As for the technological sense of enforceability on its own, if a court would not be willing to recognise the outcome of a technological execution process (i.e. mere tamper-proof execution) as legally effective, then that outcome will be superseded by any contrary legal rule. “Consider the following scenario: Alice owns a piece of land, which she wants to transfer to Bob. They happen to be early adopters of a blockchain solution that involves an electronic ledger, on which ownership of real estate interests is represented by electronic tokens. Using that blockchain solution, Alice executes a smart contract that transfers the token representing her piece of land to Bob. On the blockchain, everything goes according to plan: the token transfers from Alice to Bob, and Bob is represented on the blockchain as the new owner of that piece of land. However, it turns out that the law requires a transfer of that kind of estate in land to be effected by deed, signed and witnessed. Unfortunately, the designers of the blockchain/smart contract system did not think of this. The outcome? Absent regulations specifically recognising such electronic transfers as valid, no court will recognise Bob’s title to the asset. The court may be unable to modify the result of the transfer on the blockchain (if it is genuinely tamper-proof) but clearly if a dispute were to arise concerning the ownership of the land, the court’s view would be determined by its interpretation of the legal rules applicable to the facts and not the face of the blockchain asset ledger. The legal analysis will always trump the technological – because, even for computer‑executed contracts, the final arbiter of legal effect will be the courts.” (Clifford Chance paper) Code and contract This issue of whether a smart contract is an enforceable contract at all stems from a more fundamental issue: computer code and legal drafting are two fundamentally different things. They have a number of similarities that may tempt us to conclude that they are not that different from each other: they use specialised languages with rules as to how that language should be created and interpreted; they have formal structures with a multiplicity of functional components that interact with each other in accordance with a well-defined logic, and they even share the notion of “execution.” But scratch the surface and it is readily apparent that these are two completely separate categories of thing: on the one hand, an agreement between human agents, embodied in human language, which humans perform based on their human language interpretation of those words; and on the other hand, code that is ultimately compiled and executed by computer processors as strings of binary machine code at a high level of abstraction and yielding real-world outputs only to the extent that those computers can produce real-world outputs. You can indeed “execute” software code, but the execution of machine code on a computing platform bears no general resemblance to what it means to execute or perform a contract. Execution: the law and the vending machine The law is ultimately adaptable and has followed technological changes, albeit not infrequently with a time lag. Existing electronic execution rules may be broadly sufficient to ensuring that code-and-contract hybrids can be validly executed as contracts it is not knew. The fact that smart contracts may exhibit entirely new functionality does not mean that the law would need to develop complex new rules to cater for their execution. To return to the earlier example of the vending machine: when I insert a coin into a vending machine, I create a contract, but not because of some sophisticated technical functionality of the machine. A “wrapper” contract is created because the law interprets my inserting the coin as a valid acceptance of the offer made by the owner of the vending machine to purchase the product I have selected. The vending machine may deliver the can of soda autonomously as a real-world output, but the legal contract is created the old-fashioned way (with a little flexible interpretation): by offer and acceptance. With smart contracts, however, reliably creating that wrapper and ensuring that valid offer and acceptance has taken place will likely require an explicit process that incorporates the legal requirements for electronic execution of traditional, non-automated contracts – something like clicking an “I Agree” button before launching – rather than relying on speculative smart contract-friendly interpretations of common law rules. The relative flexibility of law with respect to electronic execution may make it better suited to smart contract implementations than legal systems with stricter formal requirements, but even so there will likely be limitations to what can be achieved, such as documents that need to be executed as a deed (as Alice and Bob found out in our earlier example). 4.6.2 Automatability: a spectrum from simple to complex Monetary transaction Asset ledger transaction External input (referred to as “oracles,” e.g. an interest rate) Dispute resolution Meta-clauses (traditional contracts often include “meta-clauses”, i.e. clauses that concern the contract itself or other clauses of the contract: principles of interpretation, alternatives clauses etc). Take, for example, severability clauses, which provide that if a clause of the contract is found to be unenforceable, it should be interpreted so as to preserve the original intent to the extent possible. Use of complex legal concepts – the meaning of certain commonly used legal concepts is subject to a wide range of interpretations that can only be settled on a case by case basis. Take, for example, a commitment by a party to use its “reasonable endeavours” to achieve a certain outcome. That wording is specifically chosen, as a matter of drafting, as an alternative to a strict obligation, to indicate that there are circumstances in which that party will not be expected to perform because to do so would go beyond a certain threshold of “reasonableness” given the particular context of the obligation. It is open to the parties to specify exactly what will and will not be reasonable, but the choice of the term “reasonable endeavours” is a way of postponing that determination, so that the standard of what is or is not reasonable can be resolved based on a concrete set of facts when an issue arises. Because this type of concept cannot be set out in a formalised language that can provide a well-defined set of instructions for code to execute. 4.6.2.1 The expanding domain of smart contracts From this overview of some key issues raised by smart contracts, we have seen that the current state of the technology suggests that effective smart contract solutions will emerge in certain well-defined contexts that lend themselves to at least partial automation of the performance of the contract. Why it is not either a Contract or Smart? A. A contract is not a “paper”; they can be represented in different forms, i.e., when you ask for buy a coffee, there is a contract an oral one, when you put a coin in a vending machine, etc. B. There are several classifications of what “smart” stands for, but because is self executable, so other contracts, namely standardised contract, like in securities trading (if anyone sets an algorithm to sell above a certain price, write “if &gt; a, then sell, is not something new or”smart&quot; per se“). C. Then there is the one that confuses contract with form (just as a “paper” is only a representation, a means of “documentary” proof, of will, of a certain order or acceptance, of a contract (because things have no will), blockchain is the equivalent to “paper”. D. A timestamp of clearance (this is not new, i.e. land/company´s house). E. There are no “smart contracts”, there are a (or several) centralised databases, but distributed (or the form of validation), has the same strength of “writing” “smart clauses in a given contract.” F. All contracts are “predefined”, or meaning, that until the parties fully agree with the terms, the contract is not complete. This also means that no one can be bounded unless fully agrees with the terms, being written in a paper or as code, does not change this basic notion. G. What are triggers, is not something the law does not know, can be written in different forms, as “suspensive clause”, for example, the only x occurs, b can claim y. (in energy look to “force Majeure clauses”, or liability clauses, they have this underlying reasoning, that some clauses are only executable if a given event (trigger) occurs). H. As you can write a bad contract, so you can code a bad contract. The settlement, most things have physical existence (property law) and for its transfer needs some action to conclude the contract (even in securities and banking, this settlement process exists, and the only difference is that the database moves from physical to digital). Basic example: A sells x kWh to B. How are you going to deliver that electricity (as you already understand, in most cases, has to be by the electricity grid). Or A sells the house to B, where for the transfer to be concluded needs a public deed. Even being recorded in a digital database, that asset will only change ownership after registration. Blockchain have a lot of uses, namely by improving efficiency of processes (as verification, settlement and trust or by (potentially eliminating the need of multiple actors in a given transaction), but is rather a database (or represented rights) than a contract, where based on those (and if using simple terms) can be executed (for example, you already have that every day, when you wire money to someone, most of that process is automated). The difference between the representative object of money and the social function of money is also discussed (a discussion similar to the configuration of the securities). Representative or represented rights Relating to the representative or represented right, there is an indisputable link between the legal situation and the&quot; representative support “. In the theory of titled securities, such connection was apprehended in the framework resulting from the qualification of the securities as credit, in particular through the idea of incorporation of the right in the title, which translates into”representation&quot; of rights or legal situations - in paper-based credit certificates, by means of the so-called incorporation, in the book-entry amounts by registration. In addition, the two forms of representation are cumulated and complemented in the cases of titles deposited in centralised system and of global title deposited in centralised system or in the financial intermediary. It may thus be said that, in the aspect now considered, securities are legal situations as represented and as represented by registered titles or “bookkeeping” (Fungibilidade de valores mobiliários e situações jurídicas meramente categorais, Miguel Galvão Teles. pp. 597-598) As written “The movement of”dematerialization&quot; of credit titles led to the appearance of another way of representing rights: purely electronic representation. Entered book values. It was therefore necessary to formulate a category which covered both figures. The term “securities” is used. It is merely conventional: another could have been chosen. The security allows quick forms of negotiation in an organized market. “In any case, security is a representation of rights: law gains representation in the sense of an externalized form that becomes relatively concrete (or less abstract). But the representation of the right is not intended to eliminate the pre-existing right. (…) The represented right remains, in the underlying plan; in the representative plan, a right tailored to the measure, covered by established forms of representation, arises. What is traded in an organized market is, it seems, the representative right, not the represented right. What is negotiated are primarily values, that is, forms of representation. This implies, it seems, the prevalence given to form over the represented right.” Electricity in the same manner also needs these elements to allow its circulation, being forced by its nature, to be represented by a tittle as one cannot own a specific quantity of electricity injected in the grid. 4.6.3 Further references Clifford Chance, “Are smart contracts, contracts?

Most of the times, banks offered this terms under certain governmental initiatives, so they act as intermediaries of such Financial mechanisms too. Or as Fiscal incentives, such as Rebates Deductions over taxable income Or other schemes They can be: Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), or a legal person, a company to perform a certain task/goal, Direct loan to acquire equipment + services contract; Rental with buy option (leasing); Other; The main implications and differences may are: * ownership and risk (namely in some events such as: bankruptcy, breach of contract, e.tc) Lastly there are EE targets for specific sectors, namely for non SME´s, Specific industries (large combustion plants), Energy intense activities; Public sector, etc) There are targets these types of entities must comply under the general EED or other national legislation. Unlike the other cases, where such improvements are not mandatory, these entities have a strong incentive: legal one, not a market one. An EPC Potential Contractual Framework may look like this, where, an EPC integrates a set of contracts. Besides the Energy Performance Contract, you may also have a Financing Contract, you still maintain or start a new energy supply Contract. An ESE may act on your behalf when setting up Financial Agreements and even the Energy Supply Contract, and you only have to deal, directly with the ESE, but this does not mean you are just bonded the ESE. 4.8 Interconnections with Public Law Most of the EE contracts may fall into a Public Contract (namely if you managing a public building, as a public hospital, school): A Public Contract (also referred to as Public Procurement) can be defined by Subjective or objective imputation, as: By type or entity (Public Entities and related); By type of Contract (more than 50% financed by public funds); By sectorial areas (specific utility markets in certain countries may be exempt from public procurement rules): If you are considering using national or EU financial schemes you may have to fulfil public procurement rules, even not being a public entity, but because more than 50% is financed by public funds) For a utility market to be exempt: * the legal/regulatory environment permits access and competition in the sector concerned; * the utility operators in the market concerned are subject to competitive pressure. The are Thresholds EU law sets minimum harmonised rules for tenders whose monetary value exceeds a certain amount and which are presumed to be of cross-border interest. The European rules ensure that the award of contracts of higher value for the provision of public goods and services must be fair, equitable, transparent and non-discriminatory. For tenders of lower value, however, national rules apply, which nevertheless must respect general principles of the EU law. Activities under concession (public interest) Activities under: liberalised market Regulated market So there are several connected subjects, you may want to have under consideration: Market structure (“ownership unbundling model”), which activities are under market conditions, which may fall under “basic services” and the ones that need special permits and authorisation. Difference between energy supply, energy management and energy performance (understanding each party´s role so as its legal framework); 4.8.0.1 Access Some activities - like distribution, metering - may be granted to a concession or can be purchased under liberalised or regulated market (typical example are the electricity supply contracts). If the proposal also carries some change in supply (as self-production, decentralized and/or local energy supply), besides specific regulation for installing, using the grid (etc.), there are special provisions for this type of activities under private law (objective responsibility, activities that carry a special level of danger, safeguard provisions) Understanding the market structure is important to know what is needed to get a permit (administrative law), what is under market conditions (private law) or when public procurements rules have to be fulfilled (administrative law). There are activities that are not under concession, like commercialisation in Portugal, but under liberalised market. For example on how bundled an “energy service contract” can be: A Contract with PV and remote monitoring, where can emerge issues such as: Self-consumption (pricing and authorisations to install them change across countries, i.e., Spain (there is “sun taxation” and Germany (has coops); Who is responsible for metering, who owns the meters, data and data access (namely for monitoring); Besides all related to investment and O&amp;M (that can demand public procurement if dealing with a public entity or EU funds); As a final mark, you can always decompose a contract to its simple elements, understand how each element relates to each other, be aware of the risks and run several simulations for the long run, with several default events and potential remedies in case of such event occur.

["regulation-standards.html", "Chapter 5 Regulation &amp; Standards 5.1 Intro Regulation", " Chapter 5 Regulation &amp; Standards 5.1 Intro Regulation We will start by understanding how policy and legal documents evolved until today. Then we will introduce to some basic concepts of different legal documents and how they related to each other, so as its dependencies. We will move on to scope, or answering the question “what are these documents trying to achieved?” How they related to connected areas, as building codes, environment and urban planning. Afterwards we will introduce the main legal documents, or the cornerstones of most national regulations and lastly, how they related and set the tone for national frameworks. Looking to the evolution and overall History, or how it evolved to its current shape. We can trace from the 50´s. 5.1.1 Trends and international agreements In the 70´s the evidence and acknowledgment of the externalities and impact, namely of the use of fossil fuels and other specially pollutant industries starts , where the recognition of the environment as a good in its own right (sometimes referred as the Third generation rights) but, nevertheless one that was always be vulnerable to tradeoffs against other similarly privileged but competing objectives, including the right to economic development. Consensus begins to form in the 1980´s and in 1988 the WMO established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change with the support of the UNEP. The Kyoto protocol was the first agreement between nations to mandate country-by-country reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. Kyoto emerged from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was signed by nearly all nations at the 1992. The framework pledges to stabilize greenhouse-gas concentrations “at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. That treaty was finalized in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, and it went into force in 2005. As a replacement of the Kyoto Protocol, in December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal. known as the Paris Agreement. The agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2°C. Along with that the UN set The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the successor to the Millennium Development Goals). Out of the 17 SGD´s, 4 related to this course: Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production Goal 13: Climate Action Looking at the overall History of Energy Efficiency in Buildings Looking at the Scope and Background of EU, The main goals are the freedom of movement of goods, persons, services and capital. The early measures up to the end of the 1970s, and then describes three main steps: the internal market; the climate change package; and the first steps towards security of supply framework. So went from trade agreement to common Energy Policy, or From European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), administrative agency established by a treaty ratified in 1952, designed to integrate the coal and steel industries in western Europe. The original members of the ECSC were France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The organization subsequently expanded to include all members of the European Economic Community (later renamed the European Community) and the European Union. When the treaty expired in 2002, the ECSC was dissolved. To Energy Union The Energy Union Strategy is a project of the European Commission to coordinate the transformation of European energy supply. It was launched in February 2015, with the aim of providing secure, sustainable, competitive, affordable energy. The European Council concluded on 19 March 2015 that the EU is committed to building an Energy Union with a forward-looking climate policy on the basis of the Commission’s framework strategy, with five priority dimensions: Energy security, solidarity and trust A fully integrated European energy market Energy efficiency contributing to moderation of demand Decarbonising the economy Research, innovation and competitiveness. The strategy includes a minimum 10% electricity interconnection target for all member states by 2020, which the Commission hopes will put downward pressure onto energy prices, reduce the need to build new power plants, reduce the risk of black-outs or other forms of electrical grid instability, improve the reliability of renewable energy supply, and encourage market integration. We can spilt 3 main waves, which reflect concerns and events of that time, so as overall incremental regulation, moving from basic needs, as supply and trade, to negative externalities, to full integration of economic and sustainable goals. In the same way regulation of basic human implementation was achieved, new layers and goads were pursuit. 1st Wave, where the goal was access to goods, namely coal, so we can trace back to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), where regulation was related to trade and tariffs. Council Directive 90/531/EEC of 17 September 1990 on the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors Directive 94/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on the conditions for granting and using authorizations for the prospection, exploration and production of hydrocarbons Directive 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on safety of offshore oil and gas operations and amending Directive 2004/35/EC The Oil Stocks Directive (Council Directive 2009/119/EC ) of 14 September 2009 imposing an obligation on Member States to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products. Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity 2nd Wave, where the goal was to improve and guarantee common safety and health standards. The Regulation of most industries, namely its externalities, as emissions and waste. As for example: Solutions to prevent and minimize environmental damages are a requirement to companies of a large number of industries that want to have licenses to operate in the market. Currently, the following main pieces of legislation applicable in this field The IPPC Directive (Integrated Pollution Prevention &amp; Control), that establish the politics on prevention of pollution; Several sectorial directives, which lay down specific minimum requirements, including emission limit values for certain industrial activities (large combustion plants, waste incineration, activities using organic solvent and titanium dioxide production). The Directive on industrial emissions 2010/75/EU (IED) that has entered into force on 6January 2011 and has to be transposed into national legislation by Member States by 7January 2013. EU European Trading Scheme (ETS) Policy, launched in 2005, works on the “cap and trade”principle. The number of allowances is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme of the Community (Text with EEA relevance) Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the geological storage of carbon dioxide and amending Council Directive 85/337/EEC, European Parliament and Council Directives 2000/60/EC, 2001/80/EC, 2004/35/EC, 2006/12/EC, 2008/1/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 3rd wave, with the aim of setting a decarbonized economy, so as an efficient and sustainable use of resources, where Regulation falls into energy markets, as electricity, gas, so as the integration of a single EU Energy Market. Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RES) Directive 2012/27/EC on energy efficiency Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC And finally the Winter Package: Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/1719 establishing a guideline on forward capacity allocation Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/1447 establishing a network code on requirements for grid connection of high-voltage direct current system and direct current-connected power park modules Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/631 establishing a network code on requirements for grid connection of generators Regulation on laying down guidelines relating to the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism and a common regulatory approach to transmission charging (838/2010/EU) On Urban Planning and Buildings we can state: 1st wave, namely after the war to reallocate, reconstruct cities and provide housing at affordable prices, so regulation was towards construction, access (housing) and property rights. 2nd wave, with the goals to set overall urban planning and assume basic standards of safety, hygiene and public health, regulation was in setting minimum standards of the last 3 goals. 3rd wave, promoting sustainable cities and communities, regulation for buildings, use of resources and setting standards, as the Energy Certification in Buildings for these assets be traded and used. Unlike in Energy, regulation from EU regarding Buildings, only emerges in this 3rd wave, where the first two were typical competences of local governments. 5.1.2 European and National Legal Frameworks - Types of Regulatory mechanisms The aims set out in the EU treaties are achieved by several types of legal act. Some are binding, others are not. Some apply to all EU countries, others to just a few. The legal basis for the enactment of directives is Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 249 TEC), under section 1 “THE LEGAL ACTS OF THE UNION” According to Article 288: To exercise the Union’s competences, the institutions shall adopt regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions. A regulation shall have general application. It shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. A directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods. A decision shall be binding in its entirety. A decision which specifies those to whom it is addressed shall be binding only on them. Recommendations and opinions shall have no binding force. Types of EU legal acts: Directive; Regulation, Decision; Recommendation Opinion A “directive” is a legislative act that sets out a goal that all EU countries must achieve. However, it is up to the individual countries to devise their own laws on how to reach these goals. One example is the Energy Efficiency Directive. A “regulation” is a binding legislative act. It must be applied in its entirety across the EU. For example, when the EU wanted to make sure that there are common safeguards on goods imported from outside the EU, the Council adopted a regulation. A “decision” is binding on those to whom it is addressed (e.g. an EU country or an individual company) and is directly applicable. For example, the Commission issued a decision on the EU participating in the work of various counter-terrorism organisations. The decision related to these organisations only. A “recommendation” is not binding. When the Commission issued a recommendation that EU countries’ law authorities improve their use of videoconferencing to help judicial services work better across borders, this did not have any legal consequences. A recommendation allows the institutions to make their views known and to suggest a line of action without imposing any legal obligation on those to whom it is addressed. An “opinion” is an instrument that allows the institutions to make a statement in a non-binding fashion, in other words without imposing any legal obligation on those to whom it is addressed. An opinion is not binding. It can be issued by the main EU institutions (Commission, Council, Parliament), the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee. While laws are being made, the committees give opinions from their specific regional or economic and social viewpoint. For example, the Committee of the Regions issued an opinion on the clean air policy package for Europe. Directives usually don´t have a direct effect. Even though directives were not originally thought to be binding before they were implemented by member states, the European Court of Justice developed the doctrine of direct effect where unimplemented or badly implemented directives can actually have direct legal force. Also, in Francovich v. Italy, the court found that member states could be liable to pay damages to individuals and companies who had been adversely affected by the non-implementation of a directive. 5.1.3 “Soft Law” Lack of features (vs “hard law” such as: obligation, uniformity, justiciability, sanctions, and/or an enforcement staff In the discussion of new governance in the European Union, the concept of “soft law” is often used to describe governance arrangements that operate in place of, or along with, the “hard law” that arises from treaties, regulations, and the Community Method. These new governance methods may bear some similarities to hard law. But because they lack features such as obligation, uniformity, justiciability, sanctions, and/or an enforcement staff, they are classified as “soft law” and contrasted, sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, with hard law as instruments for European integration. “Soft law” is a very general term, and has been used to refer to a variety of processes. The only common thread among these processes is that while all have normative content they are not formally binding. In his definition, Snyder describes soft law as “rules of conduct which in principle have no legally binding force but which nevertheless may have practical effects.” In recent years there has been an increase in interest in soft law in the EU. There are several examples of “Soft Law”: Industry standards (as ISO´s, ..); Market costumes and practices; Recommendations and opinions; They may have asimilar strength of hard law, still are not enforceable. For example the “Best Available Techniques (BAT´s), like stated in Industrial Emissions Directive and IPPC Directive, concerning mitigation and prevention mechanics.

When analyzing the legal system, using the classical distinction between: Private Law - applies to relationships between individuals (and companies) in a legal system (e.g. Contract Law) Public law applies to the relationship between an individual (and Companies) and the Government. (e.g., Administrative Law) We can see conflicting areas Energy and Environmental; Property Rights (Real Estate) and Urban Planning; For example: Property rights are delimited by Administrative Law provisions (when you need a permit to construct) or when environmental provisions cap use and access to natural resources (for example, when is required Environmental Impact Study, for starting operating large combustions plants, or by limiting the type and capacity of energy generation for self-consumption. To close, it is important to understand how each document relates to each other. Or how Directives, National Regulation and other reference documents interconnect with each other. We already know that Directives, in principle, do not have a direct effect and Member States have to fulfill internally those guidelines. Directives are approved, and Member States have a certain period to transpose these Directives into national Law. Usually there is some freedom for adaptation, because each country has its own realities and system. EU states a goal, MS have to, internally, with their own legal tools, produce the mechanics to fulfill these goals. Parliaments, can either decide to incorporate all definitions and procedures into a single piece of legislation or, attribute competence and authorization to a certain governmental entity, for fulfilling the details. A typical case is regulations to fulfill a certain piece of legislation. These entities are also mandated to execute, regulate, de application of such regulations. Technical standards, they can either be incorporated into legislation and regulations or, a certain law or legislation sends the interpretation to these technical standards produced by industry or professional peers. So these documents even not having originate features of hard law, they end having similar strength due to being used by enforceable legal pieces of legislation or regulation. A typical example would be: EU set a Directive to improve EE, Parliament transpose Directive into national law and mandates a regulatory agency to execute the attributions within this law. The regulatory agency, writes a regulation that uses as standards an international standard to define what EE means and how its measure. 5.1.5 EU regulation 5.1.5.1 EU Directives Energy Performance in Buildings Directive (2002/91/EC,2006/32/EC, 2010/31/EU) Energy Efficiency (2012/27/EU) Renewables Energy Directive (2009/21/EU) "],

Since the specific humidity takes very low values in climatization situations, the psychrometric chart is defined by the axis of dry temperature and specific humidity. Generally, the following values are considered for specific heat and enthalpy of phase: \\[h = 1.01\\times T + w(1.9T + 2480)\\] 7.0.0.19 Relative humidity The relative humidity is calculated by the ratio between the effective vapor pressure and the maximum vapor pressure.

As the present value of the \\(j^{th}\\) payment is \\(v^{j}\\), where v = 1/(1+i) is the discount factor, the present value of the annuity is: \\[a_{n}= v + v^{2} + v^{3}+...+ v^{n}\\] \\[= v \\times\\left [ \\frac{1-v^n}{1-v} \\right ]\\] \\[= \\frac{1-v^n}{i}\\] \\[= \\frac{1-(1+i)^{-n}}{i}\\] The accumulated value of the annuity at time \\(n\\) is denoted by \\(s_{n}\\) This is the future value of ane at time \\(n\\). Thus, we have: \\[s_{n} = s_{n} \\times (i+1)^n\\] \\[s_{n} =\\frac{(1+i)^{n}-1}{i}\\] If the annuity is of level payments of P, the present and future values of the annuity are \\(Pa_n\\) and \\(Ps_n\\), respectively. Given that A = annual repayment amount, the present value of one annual repayment amount paid in t years time is \\[P= \\frac{A}{(1+i)^t}\\],where \\(i\\) is the annual rate of interest expressed as a decimal or fraction Given that A = annual repayment amount, the present value of one annual repayment amount paid in t years time is Loan amount = sum of the present value of all the repayments (assuming payment at the end of each payment period) Where: \\(P\\) = Loan amount \\(A\\) = periodic repayment amount, \\(t\\) = the number of payment periods, \\(i\\) = the interest rate for the payment period expressed as a decimal or fraction \\[P =\\frac{A}{(1+i)} + \\frac{A}{(1+i)^2} + \\frac{A}{(1+i)^3} + .... \\frac{A}{(1+i)^t}\\] \\[A =\\frac{1}{(1+i)} + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^2} + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^3} + .... \\frac{1}{(1+i)^t}\\] \\[\\Rightarrow A = P\\frac{i(1+i)^t}{(1+i)^t-1}\\] This type of calculation is so common that it is convenient to derive a formula to shortcut the calculation for the regular repayment \\(A\\). By considering the general case of an amortised loan with interest rate \\(i\\), taken out over \\(t\\) years, for a loan amount of \\(P\\), a geometric series can be used to derive the general formula: \\[A= P\\frac{i(1+i)^t}{(1+i)^t-1}\\] 7.0.0.38 Net Present Value (NPV) \\[NPV_{i, N} \\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n} - Investment\\] When cash inflows are even: \\[NPV = C × 1 − (1 + i)^{-n} − Initial \\ Investment\\] In the above formula, \\(C\\) is the net cash inflow expected to be received in each period; \\(i\\) is the required rate of return per period; \\(n\\) are the number of periods during which the project is expected to operate and generate cash inflows. When cash inflows are uneven: \\[NPV = C1 + ...+C_3 − Initial \\ Investment\\] \\(C_1:(1 + i)^1\\) \\(C_2:(1 + i)^2\\) \\(C_3:(1 + i)^3\\) Where, \\(i\\) is the target rate of return per period; \\(C1\\) is the net cash inflow during the first period; \\(C_2\\) is the net cash inflow during the second period; \\(C_3\\) is the net cash inflow during the third period, and so on … 7.0.0.39 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) The Internal Rate of Return (IRR), corresponds to finding out what is the rate of return on the project that makes the NPV equal to 0. \\[IRR= \\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n} = 0\\] 7.0.0.40 Payback \\[Payback \\, Period = \\frac{Amount\\,Invested}{Estimated\\,Net\\,Cash\\,Flow}\\] 7.0.0.41 Accounting Equation \\[Assets = Liabilities + Owner&#39; s\\ Equity\\] \\(Assets = Liabilities + Equity\\) \\(PV \\ System = Accounts \\ payable + None\\) \\(1000 = 1000 + 0\\) \\[Assets = Liabilities + Capital + Revenue - Expenses - Drawings\\] 7.0.0.42 Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) \\[LCOE = \\frac{sum \\ of \\ costs\\ \\ over \\ lifetime}{sum \\ of \\ eletrical\\ energy\\ produced \\ over \\ lifetime} = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{n}\\frac{I_t+M_t+F_t}{(1+r)^n}} {\\sum_{t=1}^{n}\\frac{E_t}{(1+r)^n}}\\] \\(I_t\\) = Investment expenditures in year t (including financing) \\(M_t\\) = Operations and maintenance expenditures in year t \\(F_t\\) = Fuel expenditures in year t \\(E_t\\) = Electricity generation in year t \\(r\\) = Discount rate \\(n\\) = Life of the system 7.0.0.43 Cost-Optimaly Methodology The global cost must be calculated according to EN15459 as indicated in the formula: \\[C_{g}(\\tau) = C_I \\sum{_j}[ \\sum_{i=1}^{\\tau}(C_{a,i(j)} \\cdot R_d(i)) - C_{f\\tau}(j)]\\] Where: \\(Cg(t)\\) are the Global costs referring to the starting year τ=0, \\(Cl\\) are the Initial investment costs, \\(Ca,i(j)\\) are the annual costs year i for energy-related component j (energy costs, operational costs, periodic or replacement costs, maintenance costs), \\(Rd(i)\\) is the discount rate for year i (depending on interest rate), \\(Vf,τ(j)\\) is the final value of component j at the end of the calculation period (referred to the starting year τ=0 ), 7.0.0.44 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) \\(CAPM = R_f + \\beta \\times R_m\\) and \\(\\beta=R_f+(r_m−r_f)\\) "]
